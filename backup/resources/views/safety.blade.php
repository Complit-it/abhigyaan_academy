				<div class="row">
						<p>It is always tragic to lose someone. Road accidents are one of the main reasons why India loses someone they love on the road.</p>
						<p>Road traffic injuries are among the 5 leading causes of death in the age group of 5-45 and the majority of those killed, injured, and disabled are men in their productive years of life. Every year thousands of children become orphans or lose a parent. It affects the person involved in the accident but also the whole family.</p>
						<p>Most of the accidents are preventable and precious lives can be saved as 95% of the accidents are a result of careless behavior on the roads.</p>
						<p>Always remember the following when you are on ROAD for your SAFETY</p>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<ul>
						<li>Respect traffic rules/regulations and signs/symbols</li>
						<li>Maintain your cool even in adverse situations</li>
						<li>Care &amp; concern for others</li>
						<li>Be prepared for any kind of eventuality</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<h2>RULES OF ROAD</h2>
						<p><strong>Keep left</strong></p>
						<p>How far from the left side of the road you should drive depends upon the road condition and the type of traffic on it. But, as a driver, you must drive sufficiently to the left</p>
						<p><strong>Lane driving</strong></p>
						<p>Every road has lanes, whether marked or not. Where they are not marked, divide the road mentally into appropriate lanes. Where it is marked, drive within your lane. Change only if it is safe to do so and after giving a proper signal. A good driver never weaves in and out of a lane. In a traffic hold-up, don’t try to get ahead by jumping the queue or by cutting into another lane.</p>
						<p><strong>Changing Lanes</strong></p>
						<p>If you need to move into another lane, check through your rearview mirror and look over your shoulder for the traffic following you, if it is safe, give the proper signal and then change lanes. After you have changed your lane or overtaken, make sure that the indicator given to change lane is switched off.</p>
						<p><strong>Turning left and right</strong></p>
						<p>Whether you are going to make a left or right turn, you should be in the correct lane well before reaching the intersection. You should be in the lane closest to the direction in which you are going to turn. Never turn from the wrong lane across another lane of traffic. This unexpected move can be dangerous.</p>
						<p><strong>Reverse driving</strong></p>
						<p>Reverse driving could be dangerous. Make sure you have rear side view mirrors on your left and right doors in addition to the one fitted inside. Before you reverse, make sure there are no pedestrians, especially children, or any other impediments on the road behind you. Be particularly careful of the blind areas that are obscured from the driver’s seat. Never reverse from a side road onto a main road.</p>
						<p><strong>U Turn</strong></p>
						<p>After ensuring that there is no prohibition to take a U-turn, also make sure:</p>
						<ul>
						<li>That the road is wide enough for this manoeuvre</li>
						<li>That there is no traffic approaching from either side and you have full visibility of the road on both sides.</li>
						</ul>
						<p><strong>Speed</strong></p>
						<p>Driving at a high speed does not give you sufficient reaction time to observe hazards. Other road users too, get less time to react. The higher the speed, the greater the stopping distance and larger the chances of an accident.</p>
						<p>The golden rule for speed:</p>
						<p>Drive at a speed that will allow you to stop well within the distance you can see clearly</p>
						<p><strong>Following Distance</strong></p>
						<p>Always maintain sufficient distance between the vehicle you are driving and the vehicle in front of you in order to avoid collision in case the vehicle ahead slows down or stops suddenly. Avoid applying the brakes abruptly unless it is necessary to do so for safety reasons.</p>
						<p>The law also provides that the driver if a motor vehicle moving behind another vehicle shall keep at a sufficient from the other vehicle to avoid collision if the vehicle in front should suddenly slow down or stop.</p>
						<p><strong>Overtaking</strong></p>
						<p>One of the major causes of road accidents is callous overtaking.  So, you have an important responsibility while overtaking.  Be careful while you observe oncoming vehicles in the overtaking exercise.  You must only overtake when you are sure that after completing the maneuver you can return to your side of the road without obstructing the oncoming traffic or getting in the way of vehicles you are overtaking. </p>
						<p>Take extreme care when overtaking on roads with an undivided carriageway.  Impatient drivers may not want to reduce their speed and may remain in the middle of the road resulting in head-on collisions.</p>
						<p>When overtaking, keep in mind:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Overtake from the right of the vehicles you are passing</li>
							<li>Do not overtake if the driver of the vehicle in front of you indicates that he is turning right.</li>
							<li>Never cut onto heavy vehicles. They need more room to slow down and stop.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Do not attempt to overtake if:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Your passing is likely to cause inconvenience or danger to another traffic proceeding in any direction.</li>
							<li>You are near a pedestrian crossing, intersection, or railway crossing</li>
							<li>You are on a road where overtaking is not allowed.</li>
							<li>The vehicle you are wanting to overtake has started accelerating</li>
							<li>The vehicle to be overtaken is displaying an ‘L’ plate.</li>
							<li>Emergency vehicle</li>
							<li>VIP entourage</li>
							<li>You cannot see clearly ahead due to the dazzle of oncoming traffic</li>
							<li>A large vehicle is blocking your vision, as there may be slow-moving vehicles in front</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Parking</p>
						<p>The absence of a ‘No Parking’ sign does not necessarily mean that you can park there. Wherever possible, park off the road or in a car park. Normally, a parking space is indicated by a road sign or markings. Look for the sign and park your vehicle accordingly.</p>
						<p>ROAD SAFETY TIPS FOR PEDESTRIANS</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Walk on the footpath - 50% of those killed in road accidents are pedestrians.</li>
							<li>ALWAYS REMAIN ALERT WHILE ON THE ROAD</li>
							<li>Walk on any side of road if there are footpaths.</li>
							<li>On roads having no footpath, walk on the extreme right side facing the oncoming traffic.</li>
							<li>Always use Zebra Crossing, Foot Over-bridge &amp; Subways to cross the road.</li>
							<li>Cross the road when the vehicles are at a safe distance.</li>
							<li>Wear light-coloured dresses during the night.</li>

						<h1>Negotiating an Intersection Judiciously</h1>
						<p>Almost 50% of collisions occur at intersections.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Choose the left lane if you want to turn left, the middle lane if you want to go straight, and the right lane if turning right, at least 100 m in advance.</li>
							<li>Give proper indication before you turn.</li>
							<li>Slow down while approaching an intersection.</li>
							<li>Stop before the stop line at the red light.</li>
							<li>Even if the signal allows you to go, proceed slowly and cautiously.</li>
							<li>While approaching an unmanned intersection cover the brake and be prepared to stop.</li>
						</ul>

						<h1>Negotiating a Round About</h1>
						<ul>
							<li>Choose your lane as per your exit, at least 100m in advance.</li>
							<li>Slow down while approaching a round about.</li>
							<li>Enter the round about at an angle.</li>
							<li>Give way to traffic on your right.</li>
							<li>Merge slowly with the traffic inside the round about.</li>
							<li>Move towards your exit gradually giving proper indications.</li>
							<li>Be watchful of a pedestrian or an animal that may suddenly appear.</li>
						</ul>

						<h1>While Overtaking</h1>
						<ul>
							<li>Never overtake from left, always overtake from right.</li>
							<li>Make clear your intentions of overtaking your fellow drivers.</li>
							<li>Give proper indications.</li>
							<li>Be watchful of a pedestrian or an animal that may suddenly appear in front of the vehicle you are overtaking.</li>
							<li>On roads having two-way traffic overtake only when the oncoming vehicle is at a safe distance.</li>
						</ul>

						<h1>While Turning</h1>
						<ul>
							<li>Give proper indications.</li>
							<li>Start changing lane only when the vehicles behind you have understood your intentions.</li>
							<li>Slow down while approaching the turning point.</li>
							<li>Turn only when the vehicle coming from the opposite direction is at a safe distance.</li>
							<li>The vehicle coming from the opposite direction has the right of way.</li>
							<li>Watch out for pedestrians as well as vehicles coming from your right side.</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>Right of Way</h2>
						<ul>
						  <li>The children and the disabled have the right of way.</li>
						  <li>Pedestrians have the first right of way at unmanned intersections.</li>
						  <li>At unmanned intersections traffic on the right has the right of way.</li>
						  <li>At a roundabout, traffic on your right has the right of way.</li>
						  <li>Traffic on the major road has the right of way.</li>
						  <li>On hilly and steep roads vehicles going uphill have the right of way.</li>
						  <li>Emergency vehicles like fire brigade, ambulance, and police have the right of way.</li>
						  <li>These vehicles, while on emergency duty, can jump a red right, drive in nonentry areas, or on the wrong side. </li>
						  <li>These vehicles should be given priority and clear passage.</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>Driving at Night</h2>
						<ul>
						  <li>Be alert: pedestrians, bicycles, animals, and hand-drawn vehicles that travel without light are difficult to be seen.</li>
						  <li>Drive at a slow speed to react safely and stop in time.</li>
						  <li>Turn on the headlights when it is dark.</li>
						  <li>Drive with dipped headlights in places where the roads are amply lit.</li>
						  <li>Keep the headlights clear and clean and check them frequently.  Keep your windscreen clean because a dirty windscreen can impair your vision.</li>
						  <li>Avoid looking at the dazzling light if an oncoming vehicle is driving at a high beam and gradually slow down your speed.</li>
						  <li>To reduce the glare of lights following you, switch your interior rearview mirror to the night position or slightly tilt it or tilt the exterior rearview mirrors.</li>
						  <li>Before overtaking ensure that the oncoming vehicle is at a safe distance.</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>Driving in Rain</h2>
						<ul>
						  <li>Check the working of wipers, windscreen washing fluid system, all vehicle lights, tires, and exhaust pipe.</li>
						  <li>Be careful and reduce your speed as people may run across the roads in panic.</li>
						  <li>Be considerate to other road users, and avoid splashing water.</li>
						  <li>On slippery roads drive carefully and slowly.  In case the vehicle slips, stop acceleration and press the clutch, hold the steering in a straight position, and do not break.  Wait till you regain the grip.</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>Driving in Foggy Conditions</h2>
						<ul>
						  <li>Drive slow as distances are hard to judge and low visibility decreases your reaction time.</li>
						  <li>Do not hit your brakes in panic, you may get hit from the back.</li>
						  <li>Turn on your wipers and defroster and turn off the music.</li>
						  <li>Drive with dipped headlights, high beams produce too much glare in fog.</li>
						  <li>Use the central verge of the road to guide you.</li>
						  <li>Honk periodically to let other drivers know you are there.</li>
						  <li>Never attempt overtaking.</li>
						</ul>

						<h1>Important Road Safety Tips</h1>
							<h2>Do Not Drive When Drunk</h2>
							<ul>
							  <li>Alcohol slows down the mental process.</li>
							  <li>It increases confidence but decreases performance.</li>
							  <li>It affects the brain’s ability to control and coordinate the body’s movement.</li>
							  <li>It slows down the reflex and hence the reaction time increases.</li>
							  <li>It impairs the ability to judge speed and distance.</li>
							  <li>It also impairs vision and hearing.</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>Seatbelt Saves</h2>
							<ul>
							  <li>Seat belt saves life and reduces the severity of injuries.</li>
							  <li>With a seat belt tied around, you become a part of the vehicle, rather than a loose object that can be tossed around inside in a crash or thrown outside.</li>
							  <li>If you are thrown out of a vehicle in a crash, your chances of being killed are 25 times greater than if you stay inside.</li>
							  <li>If your vehicle goes out of control, with the seat belt on you may be able to regain control. Without it, you may not even be able to stay in the driver’s seat.</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>How to React in Case of an Accident</h2>
							<ul>
							  <li>Always carry a basic emergency kit in your vehicle, containing flares and first aid supplies.</li>
							  <li>If involved in a crash you must stop, regardless of the extent of the damage.</li>
							  <li>It is a criminal offense to leave the scene of an accident involving a fatality or a personal injury.</li>
							  <li>Exchange information with other drivers involved. Give your name, address, etc. to the other drivers and police on the scene.</li>
							  <li>If a parked vehicle or property other than a vehicle is damaged or if a domestic animal is injured, try to locate the owner or notify the police.</li>
							  <li>Do not stop at an accident scene unless you are involved or emergency help is needed. Otherwise, keep your attention on driving and the directions given by traffic police.</li>
							  <li>Shift the injured immediately to the hospital in any vehicle available.</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>Emergency First-Aid</h2>
							<ul>
							  <li>Do not move an injured person unless it is absolutely necessary.</li>
							  <li>If you must move an injured person, keep the back and neck as straight as possible by putting your arms under the back, and gently support the neck with your upper arms.</li>
							  <li>Take hold of the clothing with your hands, and pull the victim headfirst away from danger.</li>
							  <li>Check to see if the injured is breathing. If the person is not breathing and you are trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), begin administering CPR or mouth-to-mouth breathing.</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>Traffic Control Devices</h2>
							<p>Traffic control devices are all signs, signals, markings and devices placed on or adjacent to a road or highway, to regulate, warn or guide traffic to promote road safety. Every road user must be aware of these devices.</p>
							<p>Traffic control devices comprise of :</p>
							<ul>
						  <li>Traffic signs</li>
						  <li>Road markings</li>
						  <li>Traffic signals</li>
						  <li>Miscellaneous traffic control devices such as barricades, traffic cones, central refuges, speed breakers, bollards, reflective devices etc.</li>
						</ul>


						<h2>What Do Traffic Signals Indicate?</h2>
						  <ul>
							<li><strong>RED</strong> means STOP</li>
							<ul>
							  <li>Wait behind the stop line or crosswalk.</li>
							  <li>If there are no lines, stop before the traffic light at the intersection so that traffic light is clearly visible.</li>
							  <li>Wait until a green signal appears before proceeding.</li>
							</ul>
							<li><strong>AMBER</strong> means CAUTION</li>
							<ul>
							  <li>You may move on if the amber appears after you have already crossed the stop line or when you feel that your stopping may cause an accident. In any case, be careful.</li>
							</ul>
							<li><strong>GREEN</strong> means GO</li>
							<ul>
							  <li>Proceed ahead ensuring that the way is clear.</li>
							  <li>You can make a right or left turn if not prohibited by signs, but take special care and give way to pedestrians crossing the road.</li>
							</ul>
							<li><strong>FLASHING RED</strong></li>
							<ul>
							  <li>Generally provided at level crossings, bridges, airfield, fire stations, minor roads, etc.</li>
							  <li>It means you must come to a full stop and proceed cautiously after making a safety check on all approaching traffic.</li>
							</ul>
							<li><strong>FLASHING YELLOW</strong></li>
							<ul>
							  <li>Generally provided where major roads meet minor roads.</li>
							  <li>Slow down and proceed with caution, giving due attention to other traffic and pedestrians.</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
