"Consider the following statements about Communal School of Historiography in regard to History of India:

1. This school of historiography saw Hindus and Muslims as having mutually antagonistic interests.

2. This school is often used by communal political leaders for community-based mobilization in furtherance of their political interests.

Which of the above statements is/are correct:",NA,C,1 Only,2 Only,Both 1 and 2,Neither 1 nor 2,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The historians of this school, relying completely on the colonial historiography of medieval India and colonial era textbooks, viewed Hindus and Muslims as permanent hostile groups whose interests were mutually different and antagonistic to each other. 

This view was not only reflected in the writings of the historians but it also found a more virulent form in the hands of the communal political leaders. In their view, India’s medieval history was one long story of Hindu-Muslim conflict. 

As a corollary of this view, it was then argued that the 19th- and 20th-century Muslims had the ‘happy’ and ‘proud’ ever present memory of having been the ruling class, while Hindus had the ‘sad’ and ‘humiliating’ memory of having been the subject race. This, ultimately, developed mutual hatred among these groups often resulting in communal riots and, in the end led to the partition of India.",NA
The book “Mother India” was written by:,NA,D,Madam Bikaji Cama,Sarojini Naidu,Annie Besant,Katherine Mayo,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The shift in terms of the writing of women’s history began with the women’s movement of the 1970s which provided the context and impetus for the emergence of women’s studies in India. Very soon, women’s history broadened and assumed the more complex shape of gender history. In the early years, the endeavour was to write a history of women to supplement the writings of mainstream history.

Also, an attempt was made to research and compile an archive of women’s writing. An important area of research has been analysis of the way in which colonial structures, such as the legal structure, affected women’s lives. 

Women’s vulnerability due to the denial of ownership of productive resources has been focused on, in the analysis of how progressive laws shaped gender relations. In the colonial period, two works based upon the women’s question in India—The High Caste Hindu Woman (1887) by Pandita Ramabai, and Mother India (1927) by Katherine Mayo—attracted international attention.",NA

"Consider the following statements about Colonial School of Historiography in the context of Indian History:

1. The followers of this school held Indian Civilisation in high regard in terms of its values, ethos and culture.

2. However the school believed that Indians lacked the experience to rule themselves and have to be guided by British in this regard.

Which of the above statements is/are correct:",NA,B,1 Only,2 Only,Both 1 and 2,None of the above,NA,NA,NA,NA,"For the major part of the 19th century the Colonial School occupied a high position in India. The term ‘colonial approach’ has been used in two senses. One relates to the history of the colonial countries, while the other refers to the works which were influenced by the colonial ideology of domination. 

It is in the second sense that most historians today write about colonial historiography. In fact, the practice of writing about the colonial countries by the colonial officials was related to the desire for domination and justification of colonial rule. 

Hence, in most such historical works there was criticism of indigenous society and culture. Simultaneously, there was praise for the Western culture and values and glorification of the individuals who established the colonial empires. 

The histories of India written by James Mill, Mountstuart Elphinstone, Vincent Smith and many others are pertinent examples of the colonial historiographical trend. Certain characteristics common to most of the works of these historians are the following: (i) ‘Orientalist’ representation of India; (ii) the opinion that the British brought unity to India; (iii) the notions of Social Darwinism—the English considered themselves superior to the ‘natives’ and the fittest to rule; (iv) India viewed as a stagnant society which required guidance from the British (White Man’s burden); and (v) establishing Pax Britannica to bring law and order and peace to a bickering society.",NA
Nationalist School of Historiography emerged as a response to:,NA,C,Marxist School,Subaltern School,Colonial School,None of these,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The nationalist approach to Indian history can be described as one which tended to contribute to the growth of nationalist feelings and to unify people in the face of religious, caste, or linguistic differences or class differentiation. 

This approach looks at the national movement as a movement of the Indian people, which grew out of the growing awareness among all people of the exploitative nature of colonial rule. 

This approach developed as a response to and in confrontation with the colonial approach. It should be noted that the nationalist historians of modern India didn’t exist before 1947. Before 1947, nationalist historiography mainly dealt with the ancient and medieval periods of Indian history. 

Although, in the last quarter of the 19th century, a detailed and scientific critique of colonialism for the adverse economic aspects of alien rule was developed by nationalists like Dadabhai Naoroji, M.G. Ranade, G.V. Joshi, R.C.

Dutt, K.T. Telang, G.K. Gokhale, and D.E. Wacha. The only accounts of the national movement was by nationalist leaders (not historians) such as R.G.

Pradhan, A.C. Mazumdar, J.L. Nehru and Pattabhi Sitaramayya. R.C. Majumdar and Tara Chand are noted nationalist historians of modern India.",NA
