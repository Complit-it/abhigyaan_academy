"After a hot sunny day, people sprinkle water on the roof-top because :",NA,D,water helps air around the roof-top to absorb the heat instantly,water has lower specific heat capacity,,water is easily available,NA,NA,NA,NA,"<b>Option 1: Water helps air around the roof-top to absorb the heat instantly.</b><br/><br/>This option is not correct. While water can help cool down the air by absorbing heat, it is not instantaneous. The process of evaporation takes time and requires energy.<br/>Option 2: Water has lower specific heat capacity.<br/>This option is not correct. Water actually has a high specific heat capacity, which means it takes a relatively large amount of heat energy to raise its temperature. It is because of this property that water is commonly used in cooling systems to absorb and transfer heat.<br/>Option 3: Water is easily available.<br/>This option is not the main reason for sprinkling water on the roof-top after a hot sunny day. While water may be easily available, it is not the sole reason for this practice.<br/>Option 4: Water has a large latent heat of vaporization.<br/>This option is the correct answer. Water has a high latent heat of vaporization, which means it requires a significant amount of energy to change from a liquid to a gas. When water evaporates from the roof-top, it absorbs heat from the surroundings, cooling down the surface of the roof-top and the air around it.<br/>In conclusion, sprinkling water on the roof-top after a hot sunny day is done",NA
