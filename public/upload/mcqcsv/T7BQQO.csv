What is the molecular weight of heavy water?,NA,B,16,18,22,20,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is 20. <br/>CONCEPT: <br/>Heavy water: It is a form of water that contains only deuterium rather than the common hydrogen-1 isotope that makes up most of the hydrogen in normal water.<br/>Formula: D<sub>2</sub>O<br/>Boiling point:101.4 &deg;C<br/>Molar mass: 20 gm/mole <br/>Melting point: 3.8 &deg;C <br/>Density: 1.11 gm/cm^3 <br/>Refractive index:1.328 <br/><br/>EXPLANATION:<br/>Heavy water has deuterium(D) which is an isotope of hydrogen. <br/>While hydrogen has 1 proton and 0 neutrons in its nucleus giving it an atomic weight of 1, deuterium has 1 proton and 1 neutron in its nucleus.<br/>So deuterium has atomic weight 2.<br/>So heavy water, which has molecular formula D<sub>2</sub>O, has molecular mass = 16(for oxygen)+(2 × 2)(for two deuteriums)= 20",NA
What is the atomic number of an atom?,NA,B,The number of neutrons in the atom.,The number of protons in the atom.,The number of electrons in the atom.,The total number of particles in the atom.,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The atomic number of an atom is the number of protons in the atom. This number determines the element&#39;s identity. For example, nitrogen (N) has an atomic number of 7, which means it has 7 protons.",NA
What are isotopes of an element characterized by?,NA,C,Different atomic numbers and the same mass numbers.,Different atomic numbers and different mass numbers.,The same atomic numbers and different mass numbers.,The same atomic numbers and the same mass numbers.,NA,NA,NA,NA,Isotopes of an element have the same atomic number (number of protons) but different mass numbers (different number of neutrons). This means they have the same identity as the element but different atomic masses due to varying numbers of neutrons.,NA
Which of the following elements has a mass number of 40?,NA,B,Oxygen (O),Calcium (Ca),Sulfur (S),Potassium (K),NA,NA,NA,NA,"The mass number of an atom is the sum of protons and neutrons in its nucleus. Calcium (Ca) has a mass number of 40, indicating that it has 20 protons and 20 neutrons.",NA
What type of radiation does not alter the atomic number or atomic mass of a nucleus?,NA,C,Alpha radiation,Beta radiation,Gamma radiation,Neutron radiation,NA,NA,NA,NA,Gamma radiation consists of high-energy photons and does not alter the atomic number or atomic mass of a nucleus. It is a type of electromagnetic radiation.,NA
What is the sum of protons and neutrons in an atom&#39;s nucleus called?,NA,B,Atomic number,Mass number,Isotope,Allotrope,NA,NA,NA,NA,The sum of protons and neutrons in an atom&#39;s nucleus is called the mass number. It helps determine the atom&#39;s mass and is denoted by the symbol <q>A</q>,NA
What is the energy and particles released during the decomposition of unstable atomic nuclei called?,NA,C,Isotopes,Allotropes,Radioactivity,Isobars,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The energy and particles released during the decomposition of unstable atomic nuclei are called radioactivity. Radioactive decay leads to the emission of various types of radiation, such as alpha, beta, and gamma radiation.",NA
" ______ states that for a solution of volatile liquids, the partial vapour pressure of each component of the solution is directly proportional to its mole fraction present in solution.",NA,D,Boyle&#39;s law,Dalton&#39;s law,Faraday&#39;s law,Raoult&#39;s law,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is Raoult&#39;s law. <br/>Raoult&#39;s law states that a solvent&#39;s partial vapour pressure in a solution (or mixture) is equal or identical to the vapour pressure of the pure solvent multiplied by its mole fraction in the solution. <br/>Mathematically, Raoult&#39;s law equation is written as: <br/>P<sub>solution</sub>= X <sub>solvent</sub>P<sup>0</sup><sub>solvent</sub> <br/><br/>Where,<br/>P<sub>solution</sub> = vapour pressure of the solution<br/>X <sub>solvent</sub>  = mole fraction of the solvent<br/>P<sup>0</sup><sub>solvent</sub> = vapour pressure of the pure solvent",NA
Helium has ______ atomicity.,NA,D,Tetra-atomic,Diatomic,Poly-atomic,Monoatomic,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is Monoatomic.<br/>Helium is considered monoatomic because it has 1 atom in its molecule. <br/><br/>Important Points:<br/>Helium is the second lightest atom.<br/>One nucleus of a Helium atom consists of two protons and two neutrons.<br/>Helium atoms do not combine into molecules. <br/>That is why it is called an inert gas, which consists of free atoms. <br/><br/>Additional Information:<br/>Today helium is used instead of hydrogen since it is inert so non-flammable which makes things a lot safer. Hydrogen can ignite very easily when mixed with the oxygen of the surrounding air. ",NA
The electron was discovered by________.,NA,A,J. J. Thomson,John Dalton,James Chadwick,Rutherford,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The Correct answer is J. J. Thomson. <br/>Key Points:<br/>A British physicist J.J.Thomson Heightened the theory of Dalton.<br/>Thomson found the existence of extremely minute particles inside the atom.<br/>He compared the atom with a <q>watermelon</q> in which the Red part resembles the positively charged portions while the black seed resembles the negatively charged electrons.<br/>The atom itself is neutral in nature, as it has equal positive and negatively charged electrons. <br/>Thomson discovered 'Electrons' for which he got Nobel prize in 1906 A.D.<br/>Thomson proposed a better atomic theory than Dalton&#39;s atomic model.<br/>According to him, a positive charge is dispersed everywhere and the idea that atoms are made up of negative electrons embedded in a gel of positive charge was wrong.<br/>Electrons were accidentally discovered by J. J. Thomson while studying the cathode rays.<br/>The name electron was given by 'stony'.<br/>Cathode rays are emitted from the cathode in a straight line if these rays strike on metal objects there is the formation of 'X-rays'.",NA
