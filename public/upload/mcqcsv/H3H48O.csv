Chlorine reacts with saturated hydrocarbons at room temperature in the,NA,B,absence of sunlight,presence of sunlight,presence of water,presence of hydrochloric acid,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Answer B. Chlorine reacts with saturated hydrocarbons at room temperature in the presence of sunlight. <br/>Chlorine is a highly reactive element that readily reacts with unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as alkenes and alkynes, to form addition products. <br/>However, when it comes to saturated hydrocarbons, chlorine can only react in the presence of sunlight. <br/>The presence of sunlight is essential for this reaction to occur because it provides the necessary energy to break the chlorine molecule into highly reactive chlorine radicals. <br/>These chlorine radicals then react with the saturated hydrocarbon, breaking one or more carbon-hydrogen bonds and replacing the hydrogen atoms with chlorine atoms. <br/>This reaction is known as photochemical chlorination.",NA
