Which out of the following is not a function of the vacuole?,NA,D,Storage ,Providing turgidity and rigidity to the cell,Waste excretion,Locomotion,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Vacuoles are storage bubbles found mostly in plant cells. These are used for storage of food or water. <br/>The vacuolar membrane is a single layered and is called as tonoplast.  <br/>Osmotic pressure and turgidity is maintained by vacuoles.  <br/>They store toxic metabolic by-products or end products of plant cells. Such vacuoles are thrown out of the cell by exocytosis. <br/>Thus, the correct answer is Locomotion is not a function.",NA
A prokaryotic cell does not possess,NA,C,Cell membrane,Cell wall,Nuclear membrane,Both (a) and (c ),NA,NA,NA,NA,Prokaryotes are unicellular primitive organisms that possess nucleus without the nuclear membrane. <br/>They do not possess membrane-bound cell organelles. As they are unicellular organism they lack division of labor.,NA
Which cell organelle plays a crucial role in detoxifying many poisons and drugs in a cell?,NA,C,Golgi apparatus,Lysosomes,Smooth endoplasmic reticulum,Vacuoles,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Smooth endoplasmic reticulum in liver cells of vertebrates helps in detoxification. <br/>It metabolises various toxic or poisonous substances such as drugs, aspirin, insecticides (DDT), petroleum products and pollutants. <br/>These toxic substances make their entry in animal's body through food, air or water.",NA
The membrane of Golgi apparatus has connections with those of,NA,B,Nuclear membrane,Endoplasmic reticulum,Cell membrane,Mitochondria,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The Golgi apparatus receives proteins and lipids (fats) from the rough endoplasmic reticulum. <br/>It modifies some of them and sorts, concentrates and packs them into sealed droplets called vesicles.",NA
Find out the correct sentence.,NA,A,Enzymes packed in lysosomes are made through RER,Rough endoplasmic reticulum and smooth endoplasmic reticulum produce lipid and protein respectively,Endoplasmic reticulum is related to the destruction of plasma membrane,Nucleoid is present inside the nucleoplasm of eukaryotic nucleus,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Option C: Endoplasmic reticulum is related with the making of plasma membrane. It makes the proteins (with the help of ribosomes) and lipids which are used for membrane synthesis. Hence, given statement is false.<br/>Option D: Nuclear material of a prokaryotic cell consists of a single chromosome which is not membrane bound and lies naked in cytoplasm. Such, nuclear region of cytoplasm is called as nucleoid. Hence, given statement is wrong.<br/>Option A: Lysosomal enzymes are made by rough endoplasmic reticulum. The ribosomes present on rough endoplasmic reticulum are involved in protein synthesis. Almost all enzymes are proteins. <br/>So, the correct answer is A.",NA
The site of detoxification in liver cells is,NA,D,Lysosome,RER,Ribosome,SER,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The endoplasmic reticulum (smooth and rough) is an interconnected network of flattened, membrane-enclosed sacs or tube-like structure which are evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm. <br/>Smooth endoplasmic is not studded with ribosomes. <br/>The smooth endoplasmic reticulum contains enzymes which catalyze a series of reactions that detoxifies lipid-soluble drugs and other harmful metabolic substances produced. <br/>So, the correct answer is <q>SER</q>.",NA
Which plastids are colourless?,NA,C,Chromoplasts,Chloroplast,Leucoplasts,All of the above,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The chloroplast is a type of plastid which produces green coloured pigment. The chloroplast is involved in carrying out photosynthesis. It gives a green colour to leaves. <br/>Chromoplasts are a type of plastids which are responsible for the characteristic colour of flower and fruit. They are involved in attracting insects, various vectors for pollination and for fruit dispersal. <br/>Leucoplasts are colourless plastids and mainly help in storage of food compounds like starch, proteins or fats. Such colourless plastids are present in underground roots, stems.",NA

Following are a few definitions of osmosis. <br/>Read carefully and select the correct definition.,NA,A,Movement of water molecules from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration through a semi permeable membrane,Movement of solvent molecules from its higher concentration to lower concentration,Movement of solvent molecules from higher concentration to lower concentration of solution through a permeable membrane,Movement of solute molecules from lower concentration to higher concentration of solution through a semipermeable membrane,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Osmosis is the passive movement of water or any other solvent molecules from a region of higher water concentration to a region of lower water concentration through a semipermeable membrane. This brings both the solutions separated by the semipermeable membrane to the equilibrium. Therefore, option A is correct.",NA
70-80 % of volume of a mature plant cell is occupied by,NA,D,Endoplasmic reticulum,Nucleus,Cytoplasm,Vacuole,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The mature cell has simple tissues rather than meristematic tissues so they will not divide and plant cell needs vacuole to make itself rigid and various excretion and storage works are also done by the vacuoles. <br/>So, the vacuoles perform majority of the tasks of the plant cell and hence this is the reason, a mature plant cell has 70-80% of vacuoles in them.",NA
