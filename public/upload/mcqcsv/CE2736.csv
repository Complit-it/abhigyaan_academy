What is the approximate North-South extent of India from Kashmir to Kanyakumari? <br/>Options:,NA,C,2400 km,2900 km,3200 km,3600 km,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option 3 - 3200 km. This means that the approximate North-South extent of India, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, is around 3200 km.<br/><br/>To understand this better, it is important to note that Kashmir is located in the northernmost part of India, while Kanyakumari is in the southernmost part. The North-South extent refers to the distance between these two points, measuring how far apart they are from each other in terms of latitude.<br/><br/>In this case, the distance is estimated to be approximately 3200 km. It is important to remember that this is an approximation and might vary slightly depending on the specific points chosen as the start and end locations. However, the given answer of 3200 km provides a good estimate of the North-South extent of India.",NA

"With reference to the climate of India, the Western disturbances originate over which one of the following?",NA,D,Arabian Sea,Baltic Sea,Caspian Sea,Mediterranean Sea,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option 4, the Mediterranean Sea. Western disturbances are weather systems that bring rainfall to northwestern parts of India, particularly during the winter season. These disturbances are a result of the interaction between the tropical easterlies and the mid-latitude westerlies.<br/><br/>The Mediterranean Sea is an important source region for these disturbances. The sea provides the necessary moisture and instability required for the formation of these weather systems. As the disturbances move eastward, they influence the weather patterns over the Indian subcontinent. They bring rainfall and snowfall to areas like Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, and parts of Rajasthan, helping to offset the aridity of these regions.<br/><br/>The other options provided - Arabian Sea, Baltic Sea, and Caspian Sea - are not directly associated with the origin of Western disturbances in India.

The topography of plateau is ideal for,NA,D,Cultivation,Forestry,Mining,Generation of hydro power,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is Option 4: generation of hydro power. A plateau is a flat or gently sloping elevated area of land, which makes it ideal location for the generation of hydro power.<br/>Hydro power is produced by harnessing the energy of flowing or falling water and converting it into electricity. The flat or gently sloping terrain of a plateau allows for the construction of dams and reservoirs, which creates a large volume of water storage. This stored water can then be released through turbines, generating electricity. The elevation of the plateau ensures a constant flow of water, maximizing the efficiency of hydro power generation. <br/>While options 1, 2 and 3 may also be possible on some plateau landscapes, they are not specifically mentioned in the context of this question.<br/>It is importatn to note that the suitability of a plateau for any particular activity depends on various factors such as climate, soil conditions and local regulations.",NA
