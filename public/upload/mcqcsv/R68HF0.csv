Plate tectonics is a scientific theory that describes the large scale motions of Earth&#39;s lithosphere.<br/>Which one among the following statements regarding Plate tectonics is not correct ?,NA,D,Tectonic plates are composed of both Oceanic Lithosphere and thicker Continental Lithosphere,Tectonic plates are able to move because the Earth&#39;s lithosphere has a higher strength than the underlying asthenosphere,The Earth&#39;s lithosphere is broken up into tectonic plates.,"Along convergent plate boundaries, subduction carries plates into the mantle",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Option 1: This statement is correct. Tectonic plates are indeed composed of both oceanic lithosphere (which is thinner and denser) and continental lithosphere (which is thicker and less dense). This is because the Earth&#39;s lithosphere is comprised of both oceanic and continental crust.<br/>Option 2: This statement is also correct. Tectonic plates are able to move because the Earth&#39;s lithosphere is stronger and more rigid compared to the underlying asthenosphere, which is partially molten and less rigid. The strength of the lithosphere allows for the movement of tectonic plates.<br/>Option 3: This statement is correct. The Earth&#39;s lithosphere is indeed broken up into tectonic plates. These plates are like puzzle pieces that fit together to cover the Earth&#39;s surface.<br/>Option 4: This statement is not correct. Along divergent plate boundaries, it is not subduction that carries plates into the mantle. Instead, it is the process of seafloor spreading that occurs at divergent boundaries. Here, two plates move apart, and new lithosphere is created as magma rises and solidifies to form new crust.",NA
"The rigid lithospheric slabs are known as <q>Plates</q>. What would be the result, if the oceanic plate collides with the continental plate?<br/>1. Oceanic plate is forced below the continental plate<br/>2. Continental plate is forced below the oceanic plate<br/>3.

This is because oceanic plates are denser than continental plates, so when they collide, the denser oceanic plate sinks beneath the less dense continental plate in a process known as subduction. This creates a subduction zone, where the oceanic plate is forced into the underlying asthenosphere. As the oceanic plate sinks, it may also cause the overlying continental plate to buckle and uplift, leading to the formation of mountain ranges.<br/><br/>Option 1, which states that the oceanic plate is forced below the continental plate, is the correct answer. Option 2, which states that the continental plate is forced below the oceanic plate, is incorrect because it is the opposite of what actually happens. Option 3, which states that continental and oceanic plates never collide, is also incorrect because continental-oceanic plate collisions do occur and are responsible for various geological phenomena such as volcanic activity and the formation of island arcs.",NA
What would happen if phytoplankton of an ocean is completely destroyed for some reason?<br/>1. The ocean as a carbon sink would be adversely affected.<br/>2. The food chains in the ocean would be adversely affected.<br/>3.

If phytoplankton were completely destroyed, the ocean&#39;s ability to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and act as a carbon sink would be severely affected.<br/>The food chains in the ocean would be adversely affected: Phytoplankton forms the base of the marine food chain and is the primary source of food for many marine organisms, including fish, whales, and zooplankton. If phytoplankton were completely destroyed, the entire marine ecosystem would be adversely affected, and many species would struggle to find food, leading to a collapse of the food chain.<br/>The density of ocean water would not drastically decrease: While phytoplankton does contribute to the production of oxygen in the ocean, its absence would not drastically decrease the density of ocean water.<br/>Therefore, the correct answer is 1 and 2 only.",NA
Which one among the following explains the earthquakes of the eastern margins of Asia?,NA,A,Subduction of Pacific plate under Asiatic plate,Subduction of African plate below European plate,Subduction of Indian plate under Asiatic Plate,Subduction of American plate under the Pacific plate,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Option 1 explains the earthquakes of the eastern margins of Asia. This is because the eastern margins of Asia are located along the Ring of Fire, which is a major area in the basin of the Pacific Ocean where a large number of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur. The Ring of Fire is formed due to the subduction of the Pacific plate under the neighboring continental plates, including the Asiatic plate.<br/>Subduction is a geological process where one tectonic plate is forced beneath another plate and into the Earth&#39;s mantle. In the case of the earthquakes along the eastern margins of Asia, the Pacific plate is subducting under the Asiatic plate. This subduction leads to the build-up of stress and energy, which is then released in the form of earthquakes.<br/>Option 2 is incorrect because it describes the subduction of the African plate below the European plate, which is not relevant to the earthquakes in the eastern margins of Asia.<br/>Option 3 is incorrect because it describes the subduction of the Indian plate under the Asiatic plate. While this subduction does occur further south, it does not explain the earthquakes specifically along the eastern margins of Asia.<br/>Option 4 is incorrect because it describes the subduction of the American plate under the Pacific plate, which is not relevant",NA

Mid-Ocean ridges form long chains of what that rise up from the ocean floor.,NA,C,Valleys,Rivers,Mountains,Rocks,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Mid-Ocean ridges are underwater mountain ranges that form as tectonic plates move apart. The movement of the plates causes magma to rise and create new crust, which results in the formation of these mountainous ridges. These ridges can stretch for thousands of kilometers and are characterized by volcanic activity, earthquakes, and the presence of hydrothermal vents. Therefore, the correct answer is <b>Mountains</b>",NA
What does seafloor spreading explain?,NA,A,Continental Drift Theory,Fossil Fuels,Both a and b,Flood,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Seafloor spreading explains the phenomenon of continental drift. It is the process by which new oceanic crust is formed at mid-ocean ridges and spreads outwards, pushing the existing crust apart. This movement of the oceanic crust causes the continents to move and drift over time. The theory of seafloor spreading provides a mechanism for explaining how the continents have moved and changed their positions on the Earth&#39;s surface throughout history.",NA
The process by which magma rises forming new oceanic lithosphere layer is called,NA,A,Sea Floor Spreading,Thermal Reversal,Magnetic reversal,Electric Reversal,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sea floor spreading is the correct answer because it refers to the process where magma rises from the Earth's mantle, creating new oceanic lithosphere. As the magma cools and solidifies, it forms a new layer of crust on the ocean floor. This process occurs at mid-ocean ridges, where tectonic plates are moving apart, allowing for the upwelling of magma. Sea floor spreading plays a crucial role in the theory of plate tectonics and is responsible for the continuous expansion of the ocean basins",NA
Seafloor spreading theory is also known as,NA,C,Theory of Hypothesis,Theroy of plate tectonics,Mid-Ocean Ridge system,None of the above,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is <q>the mid-ocean ridge system</q>. This is because seafloor spreading theory explains how new oceanic crust is formed at the mid-ocean ridges, where tectonic plates are moving apart. As the plates separate, magma rises from the mantle and solidifies to form new crust, pushing the existing crust away from the ridge. This process of crust formation and movement is known as seafloor spreading, and it occurs primarily at the mid-ocean ridge system. Therefore, the theory of seafloor spreading is closely associated with the mid-ocean ridge system.",NA
In which year the seafloor spreading theory was proposed?,NA,A,1960,1970,1971,1975,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The seafloor spreading theory was proposed in 1960.
