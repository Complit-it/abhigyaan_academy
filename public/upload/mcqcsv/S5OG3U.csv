What is the correct sequence from the smallest to the largest grain of the following types of clastic rocks?,NA,B,"Shale, sandstone, conglomerate, siltstone","Shale, siltstone, sandstone, conglomerate","Conglomerate, sandstone, shale, siltstone","Sandstone, siltstone, conglomerate, shale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct sequence from the smallest to the largest grain size among the given types of clastic rocks is option 2: Shale, siltstone, sandstone, conglomerate.<br/>Shale is the finest-grained type of clastic rock, consisting of clay and fine sediment particles. It has the smallest grain size among the options provided.<br/>Siltstone is the next in the sequence, which has slightly larger grain sizes than shale. It is made up of silt-sized particles, which are finer than sand but coarser than clay.<br/>Sandstone comes next in the sequence, made up of sand grains. Sand grains are larger than silt grains and are visible to the naked eye.<br/>Conglomerate is the coarsest-grained rock among the options, consisting of rounded or angular gravel-sized grains. It has the largest grain size.<br/>Therefore, option 2 is correct as it follows the correct sequence based on the increasing grain size from smallest (shale) to largest (conglomerate).",NA
