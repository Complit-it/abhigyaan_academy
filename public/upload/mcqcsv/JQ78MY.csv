Cyclones are caused due to,NA,A,low pressure,high pressure,low temperature,high density,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Cyclones are caused due to low pressure. <br/>Low pressure systems, also known as cyclones, occur when the air pressure at the surface is lower than the surrounding air. This low pressure draws in surrounding air, causing it to rise and creating a vertical circulation. As the air rises, it cools and condenses, forming clouds and precipitation.<br/><br/>High pressure systems, on the other hand, are the opposite of cyclones. In high pressure systems, the air pressure at the surface is higher than the surrounding air, resulting in sinking air and clearer skies. High pressure systems are associated with calm weather conditions.<br/><br/>Low temperature and high density are not direct causes of cyclones. While low temperature and high density of air can contribute to changes in pressure, they are not the primary factors that cause the formation of cyclones.<br/><br/>In summary, cyclones are caused by low pressure systems, which lead to the rise of air and the formation of clouds and precipitation.",NA
The eye of the cyclone has :,NA,A,abnormally high temperature and lowest pressure,abnormally low temperature and pressure,clear sky and lowest temperature,dense cloud cover and low pressure,NA,NA,NA,NA,"In a cyclone, the <q>eye</q> refers to the center of the storm, which is typically characterized by calm weather conditions. <br/>Looking at the options provided:<br/>Option 1 suggests that the eye of the cyclone has an abnormally high temperature and the lowest pressure. This is indeed correct. The temperature in the eye of the cyclone is relatively higher compared to the surrounding areas, and the pressure is at its lowest point. This is because the air in the eye of the cyclone is descending and warming due to compression. The low pressure at the center allows for air to rise and form the outer bands of the storm.<br/><br/>Option 2 suggests that the eye of the cyclone has abnormally low temperature and pressure. This is not accurate, as the temperature in the eye is generally higher than the surrounding areas.<br/>Option 3 suggests that the eye of the cyclone has clear sky and the lowest temperature. This is also incorrect, as the eye of the cyclone is usually cloud-free, but the temperature is not necessarily the lowest.<br/>Option 4 suggests that the eye of the cyclone has dense cloud cover and low pressure. While the low pressure is true, the dense cloud cover is not present in the eye of the storm.",NA

Which one among the following statements relating to an anticyclone is correct?,NA,A,Anticyclone is a wind system with a high pressure center,In an anticyclone the movement of wind is inward,The contribution of an anticyclone towards determining the weather of an area is quite significant.,The movement of wind is clockwise in an anticyclone in the Southern Hemisphere.,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Option 1 states that an anticyclone is a wind system with a high pressure center. This statement is correct. An anticyclone is a weather system characterized by high atmospheric pressure at its center. In an anticyclone, air descends from higher altitudes, causing the air pressure at the surface to increase. As a result, the movement of wind in an anticyclone is outward from the high-pressure center. This means that the wind blows in a clockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere and counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.<br/><br/>Option 2 states that in an anticyclone, the movement of wind is inward. This statement is incorrect as the movement of wind in an anticyclone is outward.<br/><br/>Option 3 states that the contribution of an anticyclone towards determining the weather of an area is quite significant. This statement is true. Anticyclones often bring fair weather conditions, with clear skies, light winds, and stable atmospheric conditions.<br/><br/>Option 4 states that the movement of wind is clockwise in an anticyclone in the Southern Hemisphere. This statement is correct. In the Southern Hemisphere, anticyclones are associated with clockwise wind circulation.",NA

"When the wind blow from all sides to the central low in an anti-clockwise direction, then this phenomenon is known as",NA,C,anti-tropical cyclones of the southern hemisphere,temperate cyclones of the northern hemisphere,tropical cyclones of northern hemisphere,tropical cyclones of southern hemisphere,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is Option C.<br/>Option 1 refers to anti-tropical cyclones of the southern hemisphere. This means that the wind blows from all sides to a central high-pressure area, rather than a central low. Therefore, option 1 is incorrect.<br/><br/>Option 2 refers to temperate cyclones of the northern hemisphere. While temperate cyclones do have low-pressure areas, the wind typically blows counterclockwise around them. In this phenomenon, the wind is blowing toward the central low-pressure area in an anti-clockwise direction. Therefore, option 2 is incorrect.<br/><br/>Option 3 states that when the wind blows from all sides to the central low in an anti-clockwise direction, it is known as tropical cyclones of the northern hemisphere.

"Statement I : Anticyclone, which is a high pressure wind system, does not bring about significant change in weather condition.<br/>Statement II : The outward movement of wind from the high pressure center keeps limited scope for weather disturbance.",NA,A,Both the statements are individually true and statement II is the correct explanation of Statement I,Both the statements are individually true but statement II is not the correct explanation of Statement I,Statement I is true but statement II is false,Statement I is false but statement II is true,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The statement I states that an anticyclone, which is a high pressure wind system, does not bring about significant changes in weather conditions. This statement is true. Anticyclones are characterized by sinking air and the absence of clouds, making them stable weather systems. They are often associated with clear and calm weather.<br/><br/>The statement II explains that the outward movement of wind from the high pressure center of an anticyclone keeps limited scope for weather disturbance. This statement is also true. The high pressure center of an anticyclone causes the air to diverge and move away from the center. As a result, the air tends to sink and suppress vertical movement, leading to stable atmospheric conditions and limited opportunities for weather disturbances such as cloud formation or precipitation.<br/><br/>Therefore, both statements are true, and statement II is the correct explanation of statement I. The outward movement of wind and the absence of significant weather disturbances are linked to the characteristics of anticyclones, making the explanation accurate.",NA
"Consider the following statements.<br/>I. In a cyclone, the direction of wind flow is counter clockwise in the northern hemisphere. <br/>II.

This statement is correct. In the northern hemisphere, cyclones have a low-pressure center, and the air flows inward toward the center. Due to the Coriolis effect, the wind gets deflected to the right, resulting in a counter-clockwise rotation.<br/><br/>Statement II states that tropical cyclones fade away when they reach land because there is no large supply of warm moist air. This statement is also correct. Tropical cyclones derive their energy from warm ocean waters, and when they move over land, they lose their source of warm, moist air. Without this source of energy, the cyclone weakens and eventually dissipates.<br/><br/>Therefore, both statements are correct. In a cyclone, the wind flows counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and tropical cyclones fade away when they reach land due to the lack of warm moist air.",NA
Mid-latitude cyclones:,NA,D,usually move across North America rom east to west,are generally found only over the Ocean,generally bring clear skies and little precipitation,are formed in regions of strong temperature contrasts,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option 4: Mid-latitude cyclones are formed in regions of strong temperature contrasts.<br/>Option 1: This statement is incorrect. Mid-latitude cyclones typically move from west to east, not from east to west. They are often referred to as <q>west to east storms</q> due to their eastward movement across the mid-latitudes of the Earth.<br/><br/>Option 2: This statement is incorrect. Mid-latitude cyclones can form over both land and ocean. While they are more commonly associated with the ocean, they can also develop over land regions with strong temperature contrasts.<br/><br/>Option 3: This statement is incorrect. Mid-latitude cyclones are known for bringing unsettled weather conditions such as clouds, precipitation, and strong winds.

Assertion(A): Tropical cyclones do not develop very close to the Equator.<br/>Reason (R) : A weak coriolis effect retards the development of circular air motion.,NA,A,Both A and R are individually true and R is the correct explanation of A,Both A and R are individually correct true but R is not the correct explanation of A,A is true but R is false,A is false but R is true,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Option 1 states that both the assertion (A) and the reason (R) are true, and R is the correct explanation of A.<br/>The assertion states that tropical cyclones do not develop very close to the Equator. This is true because one of the key requirements for the formation of tropical cyclones is the Coriolis effect, which is created by the rotation of the Earth. This effect deflects the path of moving air masses, resulting in the development of circular air motion in cyclones. However, the Coriolis effect is weakest at the equator and increases towards the poles.<br/><br/>The reason given is that a weak Coriolis effect retards the development of circular air motion. This is also true because the Coriolis effect is directly related to the development of cyclones. When the Coriolis effect is weak, as it is near the Equator, it hinders the formation of the necessary circular air motion that is characteristic of tropical cyclones.<br/><br/>Therefore, option 1 accurately states that both the assertion and the reason are individually true, and the reason provides the correct explanation of the assertion.",NA
"Whenever a tropical cyclone moves to land, much of its severity is reduced.

The China Sea is prone to typhoons, which are tropical cyclones that are common in the western North Pacific Ocean.<br/><br/>Option 2: Gulf of Mexico and Hurricanes. This pair is correctly matched. The Gulf of Mexico is known for its susceptibility to hurricanes, which are intense tropical cyclones that form over warm ocean waters.<br/><br/>Option 3: North-West Australia and Willy Willies. This pair is correctly matched. Willy Willies are an Australian term for tropical cyclones or whirlwinds that occur in the north-western regions of Australia.<br/><br/>Option 4: Indian Ocean and Tornadoes. This pair is not correctly matched. Tornadoes are more commonly associated with regions such as the central United States, known as <q>Tornado Alley</q>.

During the Indian monsoon season,NA,B,the westerly jet stream alone exists in the Indian region,the easterly jet stream alone exists in the Indian region,both westerly and easterly jet streams exists in the Indian region,both westerly and easterly jet streams disappear,NA,NA,NA,NA,"During the Indian monsoon season, the correct answer is option 2 - the easterly jet stream alone exists in the Indian region.<br/><br/>Jet streams are narrow, fast-moving air currents in the upper atmosphere. In the Indian region, there are two main jet streams known as the westerly and easterly jet streams.<br/><br/>The westerly jet stream exists during the winter months, bringing cold air from the western regions towards the Indian subcontinent. However, during the monsoon season, the westerly jet stream weakens and moves towards the north, causing it to no longer exist in the Indian region.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the easterly jet stream becomes dominant during the monsoon season. It brings warm and moist air from the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea towards the Indian subcontinent, resulting in heavy rainfall and the monsoon season.<br/><br/>Therefore, option 2 is correct as only the easterly jet stream exists in the Indian region during the monsoon season.",NA

While similar to the ITCZ, the ITCZ specifically refers to the area of convergence.<br/><br/>Option 2: Jet streams are high altitude air currents that flow in narrow bands within the atmosphere. They are not directly related to the convergence of trade winds near the equator.<br/><br/>Option 4: Upper air monsoons are seasonal wind patterns in the upper atmosphere that bring monsoon rains to different regions. They are not directly related to the convergence of trade winds near the equator.<br/><br/>In summary, the correct term for the convergence of the north east and south east trade winds near the equator is the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) (Option 3).",NA
