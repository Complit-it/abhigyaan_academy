Nominal GNP is same as,NA,D,Real GNP,GNP less Net factor income from abroad,GNP at constant prices,GNP at current prices,NA,NA,NA,NA,"GNP Deflator: It is clear that nominal GNP usually exceeds real GNP because of inflation. Greater the difference between nominal and real GNP, greater is the inflation. It may happen that GNP data at constant prices may not be available in the economy.",NA
Real GNP is same as,NA,C,Nominal GNP,GNP at current prices,GNP at constant prices,GNP less Net factor income from abroad,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is C: GNP at constant prices. <br/><br/>Real Gross National Product (GNP) is the value of the final goods and services produced within a country's borders in a given year, adjusted for changes in the prices of goods and services. It is calculated using constant prices, which means that the prices used to value the goods and services are from a base year, rather than the current year. This helps to eliminate the effect of inflation on the GNP calculation.<br/><br/>Nominal GNP, on the other hand, is the value of the final goods and services produced within a country's borders in a given year, valued at current market prices. It includes the effect of inflation.<br/><br/>GNP at current prices is the same as nominal GNP.<br/><br/>GNP less Net factor income from abroad is a measure of Gross National Income (GNI), which is similar to GNP but includes income earned by domestic residents from foreign sources, such as rent or dividends.",NA

State which one of the following is true.,NA,C,Gross domestic capital formation is always greater than gross fixed capital formation.,Nominal GDP can never be less that real GDP,Capital formation is a flow,Bread is always a consumer good.,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is C: Capital formation is a flow. <br/><br/>Capital formation is the process of creating or increasing the stock of capital goods in an economy. It can be either gross or net, depending on whether it includes depreciation of capital goods. Gross capital formation includes the entire value of new capital goods produced, while net capital formation subtracts the value of capital goods that are no longer in use or have been consumed through wear and tear.<br/><br/>Gross domestic capital formation refers to the total value of new capital goods produced within a country's borders, while gross fixed capital formation specifically refers to the value of new physical capital goods such as machinery, buildings, and infrastructure. Gross domestic capital formation can be greater or lesser than gross fixed capital formation, depending on the mix of capital goods being produced in a given year.<br/><br/>Nominal GDP is the value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders in a given year, valued at current market prices. Real GDP is the value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders in a given year, adjusted for changes in the prices of goods and services. Nominal GDP can be greater or lesser than real GDP, depending on whether the economy is experiencing inflation or deflation.<br/><br/>Bread is an example of a consumer good, which is a type of final good or service that is consumed by households rather than used in the production of other goods or services.",NA

It focuses on the behavior of individual economic agents, such as consumers, firms, and industries. Microeconomics is concerned with the allocation of resources at the micro level, such as how households and firms decide what to produce, how much to produce, and at what price to sell their products.<br/><br/>Macroeconomics, on the other hand, is the study of the economy as a whole. It focuses on the behavior of aggregate variables, such as GDP, unemployment, and inflation, and how they are affected by economic policies. Macroeconomics is concerned with the overall performance of the economy and the interrelationships among the various sectors of the economy.<br/><br/>Microeconomics does not only deal with prices, and it is not only concerned with government decisions.

An example of non durable goods is,NA,B,TV,Milk,Microwave,None of These,NA,NA,NA,NA,"An example of non-durable goods is milk.<br/>Non-durable goods are products that have a short lifespan and are typically consumed or used up quickly. They are often perishable and cannot be stored for long periods of time. Milk is a perfect example of a non-durable good because it spoils relatively quickly and cannot be used once it has expired.<br/>Here is a breakdown of why milk is considered a non-durable good:<br/>1. Perishability: Milk is a perishable product that has a limited shelf life. It needs to be refrigerated and consumed within a certain period of time before it spoils.<br/>2. Consumption: Milk is a consumable product that is typically used up quickly. Once opened, it needs to be consumed within a few days to ensure freshness and quality.<br/>3. Storage limitations: Milk cannot be stored for long periods of time without spoiling. It requires proper refrigeration to maintain its freshness and prevent bacterial growth.<br/>4. Short lifespan: Compared to durable goods like televisions or microwaves, milk has a significantly shorter lifespan. It cannot be used or consumed once it reaches its expiration date.<br/>In contrast, durable goods like televisions and microwaves are designed to last for a longer period of time and are not meant to be consumed or used up quickly. They can be stored and used repeatedly over an extended period without losing their functionality.<br/>Therefore, milk is an example of a non-durable good due to its perishability, limited shelf life, and the need for proper storage and consumption within a short period of time.",NA
An example of semi durable goods is,NA,C,TV,Fan,Crockery,Milk,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Semi durable goods are products that have a longer lifespan than non-durable goods but a shorter lifespan than durable goods. These goods are typically used repeatedly over a period of time but eventually wear out or become obsolete. An example of semi durable goods is crockery.<br/>Explanation:<br/>Crockery refers to dishes, plates, bowls, and other utensils used for serving and eating food. Here's why it can be classified as a semi durable good:<br/>1. Longer lifespan: Crockery is designed to withstand repeated use and can last for a relatively long time compared to non-durable goods like paper plates or disposable cutlery.<br/>2. Regular use: Crockery is used on a daily basis for serving meals, making it a semi durable good that fulfills a basic need.<br/>3. Subject to wear and tear: While crockery may have a longer lifespan, it is still susceptible to damage or breakage over time due to accidents or mishandling.<br/>4.Replacement cycle: Unlike durable goods such as furniture or appliances that may last for many years, crockery often needs to be replaced or replenished periodically as individual pieces become damaged or worn out.<br/>5. Style and design changes: Crockery may also become obsolete or less desirable over time as trends and preferences in tableware change, prompting consumers to update their sets.<br/>In conclusion, crockery is considered a semi durable good due to its longer lifespan compared to non-durable goods, regular use, susceptibility to wear and tear, periodic replacement needs, and potential for becoming outdated.",NA
An example of capital goods is,NA,B,Microwave,Plant,Fan,TV,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Capital goods are man-made, durable items businesses use to produce goods and services. They include tools, buildings, vehicles, machinery and equipment.<br/>Capital goods are also called durable goods, real capital, and economic capital. Some experts just refer to them as ""capital.""
