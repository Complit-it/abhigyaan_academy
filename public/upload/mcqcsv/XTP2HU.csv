When the economy is facing a downturn and incomes decrease, individuals&#39; tax payments also decrease, providing them with more disposable income. This increased disposable income can then be used to stimulate consumption and boost economic activity. On the other hand, during an economic upswing, incomes increase, leading to higher tax payments and reducing disposable income. This helps to moderate excessive economic growth and prevent inflationary pressures. Therefore, personal income tax acts as an automatic stabilizer as it adjusts to the changing economic conditions, helping to smooth out fluctuations in the economy.",NA
