Number of rain gauging stations in any basin depends on the,NA,D,extent of area,climatic conditions,topographic conditions,all of these,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Explanation:<br/>The number of rain gauging stations in any basin indeed depends on:<br/>Extent of Area:<br/>For larger basins or catchment areas, more rain gauges will be required to accurately measure and record rainfall across the entire area in order to capture the spatial variability.<br/><br/>Climatic Conditions:<br/>Different climates can require different numbers of rain gauges. For example, in areas with complex weather patterns or microclimates, a higher density of rain gauges might be required for accurate representation.<br/><br/>Topographic Conditions:<br/>The topography of an area could dramatically affect the distribution of rainfall. High terrain variance, mountain ranges, or steep valleys could all influence local weather patterns, necessitating more rain gauges to capture this variability.",NA

Air becomes saturated by the cooling of molecules present in the air, and the addition of water vapour to these molecules results in the saturation of the air.<br/><br/>Forms of precipitaion:<br/><u>Raindrops :</u> Raindrops or rain is the most observed kind of precipitation in the atmosphere. Clouds are formed of water droplets, dirt and dust. When the amount of water droplets exceeds and the cloud becomes heavy, they fall down onto the surface of earth. Raindrops can have a diameter of 6mm. These water droplets combine each to form a bigger water droplet. The droplets freeze onto a crystal of ice, this process is known as coalescence. Large drops of water fall to the Earth&#39;s surface, they break up into smaller drops in the form of rain.<br/><br/><u>Snowflakes :</u> When the temperature freezes the tiny cloud droplets, snow crystals are formed. It is basically flaky ice crystals that have an average density of 0.1g/cc. Water vapours being large in number, force the ice droplets to evaporate, ice crystals grow at the expense of these droplets.<br/><br/><u>Sleet :</u> The rain that freezes or partially freezes when falling from the sky is known as sleet.

During the occurrence of thunder and lightning:,NA,A,lightning is seen before thunder is heard,whether lightning is seen first or thunder is heard first will depend upon the distance and angle of the clouds vis-a-vis earth,thunder is heard before lightning is seen,lightning is seen at the same time as thunder is heard,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Explanation:<br/>Thundering: The continuous sound produced during the process of lightning.<br/>During the occurrence of thunder and lightning, lightning is seen before thunder is heard as light travels faster than sound.<br/>The speed of light is 3 x 108 m/s and the speed of sound is 343 m/s.<br/>When the positive and negative charges grow large enough, a giant spark or lightning occurs between the two charges within the cloud.<br/><br/>Lightning is an electrical discharge caused by imbalances between storm clouds and the ground, or within the clouds themselves.<br/>Thunder is caused by lightning.

Cloud burst means,NA,B,Formation of artificial rain,"Abnormally heavy downpour of rain, associated with thunderstorm",Presence of scattered flakes of cloud in the sky,Sowing of seeds of a crop in a cloudy weather,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option 2: <q>Abnormally heavy downpour of rain, associated with thunderstorm.</q> A cloud burst is a meteorological phenomenon characterized by an intense and excessive amount of rain falling in a short period of time.

Which one of the following phenomena verifies the fact that light travels much faster than sound?,NA,C,Twinkling of stars in night sky,Lighting of a matchstick,Thunderstorm,Mirage,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Option 1: Twinkling of stars in the night sky does not prove that light travels faster than sound. The twinkling of stars is caused by the Earth`s atmosphere bending and scattering the starlight as it passes through, creating the flickering effect.<br/><br/>Option 2: The lighting of a matchstick is also unrelated to the speed of light compared to sound. The ignition of a matchstick involves a chemical reaction that produces a small flame and does not involve the propagation of light or sound over significant distances.<br/><br/>Option 3: Thunderstorm is the correct answer. Thunder and lightning occur simultaneously, but we see the lightning before we hear the thunder. This phenomenon is due to the fact that light travels much faster than sound. The speed of light is about 186,282 miles per second (299,792 kilometers per second), whereas the speed of sound is approximately 1,125 feet per second (343 meters per second) in air. Therefore, we see the flash of lightning instantly when it occurs, but the sound of thunder takes longer to reach our ears.<br/><br/>Option 4: A mirage, although an interesting optical illusion, does not provide evidence for the speed difference between light and sound. For mirage to occur the ground should be very hot and the surrounding air cold. Mirage occurs when the layer which is above the ground gets warmed. The light ray gets refracted when the light moves through the cold air and into the hot air layer.",NA
