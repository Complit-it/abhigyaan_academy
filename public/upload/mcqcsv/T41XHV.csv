Thus the belt along the equator is called the equatorial low-pressure belt.<br/>- As the larger part of the low-pressure belt passes along the oceans, the winds obtain a huge amount of moisture.<br/>- Vertical winds (convection) carrying moisture from cumulonimbus clouds and lead to thunderstorms (convectional rainfall).<br/>- In spite of high-temperature cyclones are not formed at the equator because of <q>zero</q> Coriolis force.",https://abhigyanacademy.com/upload/gallery/1720720026.png
Consider the following statements about Air pressure and choose the appropriate option.<br/>(A) On the moon there is no air and hence no air pressure. <br/>(B) Variation of temperature causes pressure differences in the atmosphere. <br/>(C) Air always moves from high pressure areas to low pressure areas.,NA,D,Only (A) and (B) are true,Only (B) and (C) are true,Only (A) and (C) are true,More than one of the above,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is <q>More than one of the above are true</q>.<br/>Key Points<br/><br/>(A) On the moon, there is no air, and hence no air pressure. : This statement is true. <br/>Air molecules have some weight, and the large numbers of air molecules that make up the layers of our atmosphere altogether have a great deal of weight, which presses down on anything that is below it. Therefore due to the lack of air molecules, and an atmosphere, the moon has no air pressure either. <br/><br/>(B) Variation of temperature causes pressure differences in the atmosphere. : This statement is true.<br/>When the temperature of the air varies, it leads to changes in the air pressure. Warm air is less dense and exerts less pressure than cold air. Therefore, variations in temperature can cause differences in air pressure, which can result in the movement of air and the formation of winds.<br/><br/>(C) Air always moves from high-pressure areas to low-pressure areas. : This statement is also true.<br/>The movement of air in the atmosphere is driven by differences in air pressure. Air moves from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, which creates winds. This movement of air is caused by the pressure gradient force, which is the force that arises due to the differences in pressure. The larger the difference in pressure, the stronger the wind.",NA

Horse latitudes lie within the atmospheric pressure belts of,NA,C,Polar high,Equatorial low,Sub-tropical high,Sub-polar low,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The horse latitudes are regions located at approximately 30 degrees north and south of the equator. These regions lie within the atmospheric pressure belts known as the subtropical highs. <b>The correct option is option 3 - subtropical high.</b> <br/><br/>The subtropical highs are characterized by high atmospheric pressure and sinking air. As air near the equator rises due to heating, it moves poleward and cools. As it cools, it becomes denser and sinks back down to the surface in the subtropical high pressure belt.<br/><br/>In this sinking motion, the air becomes drier and suppresses the formation of clouds and precipitation. As a result, the horse latitudes are often associated with arid and semi-arid regions in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres.<br/><br/>Option 1, polar high, refers to the regions near the poles where cold air sinks and creates high atmospheric pressure. Option 2, equatorial low, refers to the area near the equator where the rising air creates a low-pressure zone.

Why the summer monsoon winds blow from south- western direction in the northern hemisphere ?,NA,D,The general direction of wind from the Indian Ocean is south-western,The presence of the doldrums around the Equator,The low pressure conditions in northwest India,Due to the effect of Coriolis force,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option 4: Due to the effect of Coriolis force. The Coriolis force is caused by the rotation of the Earth. As the Earth spins on its axis, the horizontal motion of objects is deflected to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. This deflection is what causes the wind to blow in a curved path instead of a straight line.<br/><br/>In the case of the summer monsoon winds in the Northern Hemisphere, the Coriolis force causes the winds to blow from the south-west. As the landmass of India heats up during the summer, it creates a low-pressure area. The surrounding areas with higher pressure, such as the Indian Ocean, have air moving towards the lower pressure. However, due to the Coriolis force, this air is deflected to the right in the Northern Hemisphere, resulting in the south-western direction of the summer monsoon winds.<br/><br/>Option 1 is partially correct as the general direction of wind from the Indian Ocean is indeed south-western, but it does not explain why this is the case.<br/><br/>Option 2 is not correct as the presence of the doldrums around the Equator is not directly related to the direction of the summer monsoon winds.",NA

Sailors often used to get stuck in this region for days due to the lack of wind for their sails.<br/>Statement 2 is also correct. Chinook is a type of warm, dry wind that occurs in winter. It blows down the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains in North America and can raise the temperature in a short amount of time.

Statement I correctly states that the Doldrums is a low pressure area around the Equator where the prevailing winds are calm. This region is characterized by light winds and variable weather conditions, making it challenging for sailors to navigate through. <br/><br/>Statement II provides an explanation for the low pressure in the Doldrums. It states that the low pressure is caused by the heat at the Equator, which makes the air rise and travel both northwards and southwards. As the air rises, it creates a vacuum at the surface, leading to lower pressure.<br/><br/>Therefore, it can be concluded that Statement II is the correct explanation of Statement I. The intense heating of the Equator causes the air to rise, creating a low pressure area in the Doldrums. This low pressure zone is responsible for the calm winds and unstable weather conditions observed in the Doldrums region.",NA

This is a correct statement. The Doldrums, also known as the Intertropical Convergence Zone, is an area near the equator where the trade winds from the Northern and Southern Hemispheres converge, creating calm or light winds.<br/><br/>Statement II states that the sun rays strike almost vertically over the equator throughout the year. This is also a correct statement. The equator receives the most direct sunlight because it is the closest to the sun&#39;s rays. As a result, the equatorial regions experience consistent high temperatures throughout the year.<br/><br/>Option 2 states that both statements are individually true, but Statement II is not the correct explanation of Statement I. This is the correct answer. While both statements are true, there is no direct causal relationship between them.

"In the Hadley cell thermal circulation, air rises up and finally descends at",NA,C,Intertropical convergence zone,Doldrums,Subtropical high-pressure cells,Equatorial troughs,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The Hadley cell is a pattern of atmospheric circulation in which warm air rises near the equator, moves towards the poles above the surface of the Earth, cools and descends at around 30 degrees latitude, and then moves back towards the equator.<br/><br/>Option 1: Incorrect. The Intertropical Convergence Zone is where the trade winds of the northern and southern hemispheres converge. This is not where the air descends but where it rises, leading to its exclusion as a possible answer.<br/><br/>Option 2: Incorrect. Doldrums are regions near the equator with a lack of wind due to the air rising. Again, this is not where the air descends in the Hadley circulation.<br/><br/>Option 3: Correct. Subtropical high-pressure cells, found roughly at the 30 degrees latitude in both hemispheres, are precisely the sites where air descends in the Hadley Cell. This downward motion creates a zone of high pressure.<br/><br/>Option 4: Incorrect. Equatorial troughs are areas of low pressure near the equator where air tends to rise, not descend. Thus, this option is wrong.",NA
