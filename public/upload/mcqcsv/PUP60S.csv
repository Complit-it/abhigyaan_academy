"Consider the following statements regarding the Gaseous Hypothesis by Kant:

2. He did not explain the source of energy which caused the random motion of cold matter, which was motionless in the initial stage.

He also did not explain the source of energy which caused the random motion of cold matter, which was motionless in the initial stage. The collision among the particles of the primordial matter can never generate rotatory motion in it. So it is an erroneous statement of mechanism. Kant’s assumption was against the law of conservation of angular momentum that the rotatory speed of the nebula increased with the increase of its size.",NA
