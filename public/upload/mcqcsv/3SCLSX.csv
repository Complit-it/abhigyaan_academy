"In the human body, the blood enters the aorta of the circulatory system from the",NA,B,Left atrium,left ventricle,Right atrium,Right ventricle,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option 2: Left ventricle.<br/>The human circulatory system is responsible for delivering oxygen and nutrients to the body&#39;s tissues and removing waste products. The aorta is the largest artery in the body and carries oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body.<br/><br/>To understand why option 2 is the correct answer, let&#39;s briefly review the flow of blood through the heart. Blood enters the heart through the right atrium from the body&#39;s tissues. It then flows into the right ventricle, which pumps it to the lungs for oxygenation. Oxygenated blood then returns to the heart and enters the left atrium. From the left atrium, blood passes into the left ventricle.<br/><br/>The left ventricle has the thickest muscular wall among all the heart chambers. This is because it is responsible for pumping oxygenated blood out of the heart and into the aorta, which will distribute the blood to the rest of the body. Therefore, the blood enters the aorta from the left ventricle.",NA
Which one of the following chambers of human heart receives the deoxygenated blood from the body?,NA,B,Left atrium,Right atrium,Left ventricle,Right ventricle,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option 2, Right Atrium. The human heart has four chambers: two atria and two ventricles. The atria are the upper chambers of the heart, and the ventricles are the lower chambers.<br/><br/>The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the body. This blood has already been used by the body&#39;s cells and is low in oxygen and high in carbon dioxide. It is then pumped into the right ventricle through the tricuspid valve.<br/>From the right ventricle, the deoxygenated blood is pumped into the pulmonary artery, which takes it to the lungs for oxygenation. In the lungs, carbon dioxide is released, and oxygen is absorbed into the blood.<br/>The oxygenated blood then returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins, entering the left atrium. From there, it is pumped into the left ventricle, which is responsible for pumping the oxygenated blood out to the rest of the body through the aorta.<br/>It is important to note that the left atrium, left ventricle, and right ventricle all receive oxygenated blood, while the right atrium receives deoxygenated blood.",NA
"In the human body, blood flows through a process of double circulation.<br/>Which one of the following statements is true in this regard ?",NA,A,Oxygenated blood reaches the left side of the heart from the lungs.,Blood in the left side of the heart is poor in oxygen and is brought to the right side of the heart.,Deoxygenated blood from the left side of the heart is brought to the lungs for oxygenation.,Oxygenated blood from the right side of the heart is sent around the body,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Option-1 is the correct statement. In the human body, blood flows through a process of double circulation, which means that it follows two separate paths: pulmonary circulation and systemic circulation.<br/><br/>In pulmonary circulation, deoxygenated blood from the right side of the heart is pumped to the lungs to get oxygenated. The oxygen-rich blood then returns to the left side of the heart. From there, the oxygenated blood is distributed throughout the body in systemic circulation.<br/><br/>Therefore, option-1 is correct because oxygenated blood does reach the left side of the heart from the lungs. In the lungs, carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen, and the blood becomes oxygenated. This oxygenated blood is then transported back to the left side of the heart through the pulmonary veins and is pumped out to the rest of the body through the systemic circulation.<br/><br/>Options 2, 3, and 4 are incorrect. Blood in the left side of the heart is oxygenated, not deoxygenated, so it is not brought to the right side of the heart. Deoxygenated blood from the body is brought to the right side of the heart, not from the left side.",NA
