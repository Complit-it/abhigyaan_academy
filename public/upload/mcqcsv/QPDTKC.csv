"In a plant, the xylem tissue conducts:",NA,A,water,food,water and food,None of these,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option 1: water.<br/>The xylem tissue in plants is responsible for the upward transport of water and dissolved minerals, from the roots to the rest of the plant. It is like a network of tiny tubes that run vertically through the plant. Through a process called transpiration, water evaporates from the leaves, creating a pull that draws water up through the xylem from the roots. This pull is known as the <q>transpirational pull</q> or <q>cohesion-tension theory</q>.<br/>Although option 2 mentions food, the transport of food or nutrients in plants is primarily carried out by a different tissue called phloem. Phloem tissue is responsible for the transport of sugars, amino acids, hormones, and other organic molecules from the leaves (where they are produced) to the other parts of the plant.<br/>Option 3, which suggests that xylem conducts both water and food, is incorrect because xylem is exclusively involved in the transportation of water and minerals.<br/>Option 4 states that none of the options are correct, but in this case, option 1 is indeed correct.",NA

Xylem is composed of several different cell types, including tracheids, vessel elements, xylem fibers, and xylem parenchyma.<br/><br/>Option 1: Trachea refers to a type of cell found in animal respiratory systems and is not present in plant xylem. Therefore, this option is incorrect.<br/>Option 2: Xylem fibers are responsible for providing structural support to the plant, but they do not carry out living processes. They are actually dead cells with thick cell walls. Therefore, this option is incorrect.<br/>Option 4: Tracheids are elongated cells with tapered ends that are responsible for water conduction in gymnosperms and ferns. While they are living cells, they are not the only living tissue in plant xylem. Therefore, this option is incorrect.<br/><br/>Xylem parenchyma, on the other hand, is the living tissue within the xylem. These cells are responsible for various metabolic activities and play a role in the storage and transport of carbohydrates.",NA
Which one of the following is NOT a component of conducting tissue in plants?,NA,C,Fibres,Tracheids,Pericycle,Sieve tubes,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The question is asking for the component that is NOT a part of conducting tissue in plants.

Girth of stem of a plant increases due to division of cells in,NA,B,apical meristem only,lateral meristem only,apical and intercalary meristem,both apical and lateral meristem,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer to this question is option 2: lateral meristem only.<br/>The girth or thickness of a plant stem increases through the division of cells in the lateral meristem. Meristems are specialized regions of plant tissue where new cells are actively dividing. The two main types of meristems are apical meristems and lateral meristems.<br/><br/>Apical meristems are found at the tips of growing stems and roots, and they are responsible for the lengthening of the plant. They produce new cells that elongate the stem or root, allowing the plant to grow taller or longer.<br/><br/>On the other hand, lateral meristems are responsible for the increase in girth or thickness of the plant. They are located in the cambium, a layer of tissue found just below the bark in woody plants. The lateral meristem produces new cells that differentiate into secondary xylem (wood) and secondary phloem (inner bark), leading to the expansion of the stem&#39;s diameter.<br/><br/>Therefore, the girth of a plant stem increases due to the division of cells in the lateral meristem only.",NA

Epiphytes are plants which depend on other plants for,NA,B,food,mechanical support,shade,water,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Epiphytes are plants that depend on other plants for mechanical support, not food, shade, or water.<br/>Epiphytes are unique plants that grow on the surface of other plants, such as trees, but they do not obtain their nutrients from the host plant. Instead, epiphytes have specialized adaptations, such as aerial roots or modified leaves, that allow them to attach to the host plant and extract moisture and nutrients from the air, rain, or debris that accumulates around them. They are often found in forest ecosystems where they take advantage of the elevated position provided by the host plant to access sunlight.<br/><br/>While some epiphytes may benefit from the shade provided by the host plant`s canopy, they are not dependent on it for survival. Similarly, although they may receive some water from rain that is intercepted by the host plant, they primarily obtain moisture from the atmosphere rather than relying on the host plant for water. Furthermore, epiphytes are not reliant on the host plant for food, as they can photosynthesize and produce their own energy using sunlight, carbon dioxide, and nutrients obtained from their environment.<br/><br/>Therefore, the correct answer is: <b>Mechanical support.</b> Epiphytes depend on other plants for mechanical support, using them as a substrate to grow and thrive, but they are not dependent on the host plant for food, shade, or water.",NA
