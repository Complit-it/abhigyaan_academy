"Two wires are made having same length I and area of cross-section A. Wire 1 is made of copper and wire 2 is made of aluminium. It is given that the electrical conductivity of copper is more than that of aluminium. In this context, which one of the following statements is correct?",NA,B,The resistance of wire 1 will be higher than that of wire 2.,The resistance of wire 2 will be higher than that of wire 1.,The resistance of both the wires will be the same.,"If same current is flown through both the wires, the power dissipated in both the wires will be the same,",NA,NA,NA,NA,"<b>The correct answer is option 2 - The resistance of wire 2 will be higher than that of wire 1.</b>
The electrical resistance of a wire is directly proportional to its length and inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area. Therefore, if two wires have the same length and different cross-sectional areas, the wire with a smaller cross-sectional area will have a higher resistance.<br/>In this scenario, wire 1 is made of copper, which has a higher electrical conductivity compared to aluminium, the material of wire 2. Since electrical conductivity is the reciprocal of electrical resistance, copper will have a lower resistance compared to aluminium for the same length and cross-sectional area.<br/><b>Thus, wire 2, made of aluminium, will have a higher resistance than wire 1 made of copper.</b>",NA
