Which one among the following statements is correct?,NA,A,"In summer season, the duration of the day is more in the northern hemisphere.","In winter season, the duration of the day is more in the northern hemisphere","In summer season, the duration of the day is less in the northern hemisphere","In winter season, the duration of the day is more in the southern hemisphere",NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct statement is option 1, which states that in the summer season, the duration of the day is more in the northern hemisphere.<br/><br/>To understand why this statement is correct, we need to consider the tilt of the Earth&#39;s axis and how it affects the length of day and night. The Earth&#39;s axis is tilted relative to its orbit around the sun, and this tilt is what causes the change in seasons.<br/><br/>During the summer season, the northern hemisphere is tilted towards the sun. This means that sunlight is spread over a larger area and is more concentrated in the northern hemisphere. As a result, the length of daylight in the northern hemisphere is longer during the summer season.<br/><br/>On the other hand, in the winter season, the northern hemisphere is tilted away from the sun. This leads to less sunlight reaching the northern hemisphere, resulting in shorter daylight hours compared to the summer season.",NA
The seasonal reversal of winds is the typical characteristic of,NA,C,Equatorial climate,Mediterranean climate,Monsoon climate,All of the above climates,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The seasonal reversal of winds is a typical characteristic of the monsoon climate. <br/>Monsoon winds are seasonal winds that blow over the Indian subcontinent and adjacent areas of Southeast Asia. During the summer season, the monsoon winds blow from the Indian Ocean towards the landmass of India, bringing heavy rainfall to the region. In the winter season, the winds blow in the opposite direction, i.e. from land to the sea, resulting in dry weather conditions. This phenomenon is known as the winter monsoon or the northeast monsoon. The monsoon climate is found in parts of India, Southeast Asia, and East Asia.",NA
"Wide range and variability in rainfall, torrential in character, reversal of winds and uncertain arrival are the characteristics of",NA,C,westerlies,trade winds,Monsoon climate,anti trade winds,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option 3, monsoon. <br/>The monsoon is a weather pattern characterized by a wide range and variability in rainfall, often of a torrential nature. During the monsoon season, there is a reversal of winds, meaning that the prevailing winds change direction. In the case of the Indian subcontinent, for example, the winds change from northeast to southwest. This shift in winds is a major factor in bringing about the monsoon rains.<br/><br/>The arrival of the monsoon is also uncertain, making it difficult to predict exactly when the rains will begin. This uncertainty can lead to challenges in agricultural planning and water resource management in regions that rely heavily on monsoon rainfall for irrigation and water supply.<br/><br/>Options 1, 2, and 4 are not correct. The westerlies (option 1) and trade winds (option 2) are global wind patterns, but they are not specifically associated with the characteristics mentioned in the question. The anti-trade winds (option 4) is not a commonly recognized term and does not accurately describe the monsoon characteristics.",NA
The climatic zones are classified on the basis of,NA,C,distance from the equator,elevation,rainfall,distance from the sea,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The climatic zones are classified on the basis of various factors. <br/>Option 1 suggests that the distance from the equator plays a role in defining climate zones. This is true as the distance from the equator affects the amount of sunlight and temperature experienced in an area. <br/>Option 2 proposes that elevation determines climatic zones. While elevation does have an impact on climate, it is not the sole factor defining climatic zones. <br/>Option 3 states that rainfall is the basis for classifying climatic zones. This is correct as the amount of precipitation greatly influences the type of vegetation and overall climate of an area. <br/>Option 4 suggests that proximity to the sea determines climatic zones. While it is true that coastal areas may have a distinct climate influenced by the sea, this is not the only factor considered when classifying climatic zones.<br/><br/> Therefore, the correct answer is option 3 as it accurately identifies rainfall as a crucial factor in defining climatic zones.",NA
