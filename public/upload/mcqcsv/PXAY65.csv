Living things are grouped into subgroups like plant kingdom / animal kingdom.<br/>Which one of the following is not correct for animal kingdom?,NA,B,Cannot make their own food,Body contains cellulose,Do not have chlorophyll,Migrate from one place to another,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The animal kingdom is a subgroup of living things that includes organisms with certain characteristics. In this case, we are looking for the option that does not correctly describe animals.<br/><br/>Option 1 states that animals cannot make their own food. This is correct. Animals are heterotrophs, meaning they rely on consuming other organisms for energy rather than producing their own through photosynthesis.<br/>Option 2 states that the body of animals contains cellulose. This is incorrect. Cellulose is a complex carbohydrate found in the cell walls of plants, not animals.<br/>Option 3 states that animals do not have chlorophyll. This is correct. Chlorophyll is a pigment found in plants that is essential for photosynthesis. Animals do not have chlorophyll as they do not carry out photosynthesis.<br/>Option 4 states that animals migrate from one place to another. This is correct. Many animals undertake long-distance movements for various reasons such as finding food, reproducing, or escaping extreme weather conditions.<br/>In summary, the correct answer is Option 2 as cellulose is not present in the body of animals.",NA
"Normally animals can change the place, but which one of the following animals cannot change the place ?",NA,C,Starfish,Hydra,Sponge,Leech,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option 3 - Sponge. <br/>Sponges are sedentary animals, which means they are unable to change their place or move around. <br/>- They are attached to a surface, such as rocks or the sea floor, and rely on water currents to bring them food and oxygen. <br/>- Sponges have a unique body structure with numerous pores that allow water to flow through them, which helps them filter out microscopic organisms for food. <br/>- While other animals like starfish, hydra, and leech have the ability to move and change their location, sponges lack this ability. <br/>- They mainly rely on their environment for their survival.",NA
Which of the following statement is incorrect?,NA,A,Hydra only have sexual reproduction,Most frogs are oviparous animals,Budding is possible in hydra,Internal fertilisation takes place in hens,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Option 1 states that hydra only have sexual reproduction, which is incorrect. Hydra can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Sexual reproduction occurs when two hydra come together and release sperm and eggs, which then combine to form a zygote. Asexual reproduction, on the other hand, takes place through a process called budding. During budding, a small outgrowth or bud develops on the body of the hydra, which eventually detaches and becomes a new individual.<br/><br/>Option 2 correctly states that most frogs are oviparous animals, meaning they lay eggs that hatch outside of the body. This is a common method of reproduction for frogs.<br/>Option 3 is correct as budding is indeed possible in hydra. Budding is one of the ways hydra can reproduce asexually.<br/>Option 4 is unrelated to the topic and does not affect the correctness of the statement being asked.<br/>Therefore, the correct answer is option 1.",NA
"In the evolution of animal kingdom, the first animals with true body cavity belong to the phylum",NA,A,Annelida,Arthropoda,Aschelminthes,Platyhelminthes,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option 1: Annelida.<br/><br/>The first animals with a true body cavity, known as a coelom, belong to the phylum Annelida. A coelom is a fluid-filled cavity that is completely lined with mesoderm, one of the three primary germ layers in animal embryos. This coelom provides space for various organs and systems to develop and function properly.<br/><br/>Option 2: Arthropoda is incorrect because although arthropods have a body cavity called a hemocoel, it is not a true coelom. The hemocoel is not completely lined with mesoderm but rather consists of a limited amount of fluid-filled spaces.<br/><br/>Option 3: Aschelminthes is also incorrect because they do not have a true coelom. Instead, they have a pseudocoelom, which is a body cavity that is only partially lined with mesoderm.<br/><br/>Option 4: Platyhelminthes is also incorrect as they also do not possess a true coelom. They are acoelomate, meaning they lack a body cavity altogether.<br/><br/>Therefore, the correct statement is that the first animals with a true body cavity belong to the phylum Annelida.",NA
"In which of the following phylum, would you place an animal with a bilaterally symmetrical, triploblastic body without a true internal cavity (coelom) ?",NA,B,Porifera,Platyhelminthes,Cnidera,Annelida,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option 2: Platyhelminthes.<br/>To understand why Platyhelminthes is the correct answer, let us break down the criteria given in the question. The question states that the animal has a bilaterally symmetrical body, which means its left and right sides are mirror images of each other. This characteristic is found in many organisms, but we need to consider the other criteria as well.<br/>The question also mentions that the animal has a triploblastic body, which means it has three germ layers: the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. These layers give rise to various tissues and organs in the body.<br/>Finally, the question states that the animal does not have a true internal cavity or coelom. A true coelom is a fluid-filled cavity between the body wall and the gut. It is found in organisms belonging to certain phyla such as Annelida (option 4).<br/>Considering all these criteria, we can conclude that Platyhelminthes (option 2) is the correct answer. Platyhelminthes, commonly known as flatworms, have a bilaterally symmetrical, triploblastic body without a true coelom.",NA
"Animals which are marine, bilaterally symmetrical, have a coelom and a notochord, but never form a vertebral column are placed under which one of the following groups ?",NA,B,Chordata,Protochordata,Vertebrata,Mammalia,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option 2, Protochordata. This group includes marine animals that are bilaterally symmetrical, have a coelom (body cavity), and possess a notochord (a flexible rod-like structure providing support). However, these animals do not develop a vertebral column, which is a defining feature of the subphylum Vertebrata.<br/><br/>Let us further explore the other options to understand why they are not the correct choices:<br/>- Option 1, Chordata, is a broader group that includes all animals possessing a notochord at some point in their life cycle. While Protochordata is a member of the Chordata group, not all Chordata organisms are Protochordates.<br/>- Option 3, Vertebrata, encompasses animals that possess a backbone or vertebral column, which differentiates them from Protochordates. Therefore, animals without a vertebral column cannot be classified as Vertebrata.<br/>- Option 4, Mammalia, is a class within the subphylum Vertebrata. Mammals are a specialized group characterized by features such as mammary glands and hair, but not all animals within the subphylum Vertebrata are mammals.",NA
Which one among the following groups is the most abundant in terms of number of species identified?,NA,D,Fungi,Green plants,Bacteria,Insects,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option 4 - Insects. In terms of the number of identified species, insects are the most abundant group.<br/><br/>Option 1 - Fungi: Fungi are a diverse group of organisms, but they have fewer identified species compared to insects. Fungi include organisms like mushrooms, yeasts, and molds.<br/>Option 2 - Green plants: Green plants also have a large number of identified species, but they are less abundant than insects. Green plants include flowering plants, ferns, mosses, and algae.<br/>Option 3 - Bacteria: Bacteria are a highly diverse group of microorganisms, but they have comparatively fewer identified species than insects. Bacteria are found in various habitats and play important roles in ecosystems.<br/>Option 4 - Insects: Insects are incredibly diverse, with over a million identified species. They are found in nearly every habitat on Earth and play essential roles in ecosystems as pollinators, decomposers, and prey for other animals.<br/>In conclusion, while all the options are diverse groups, insects have the highest number of identified species, making them the most abundant group in terms of species.",NA
