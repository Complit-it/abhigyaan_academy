<b>Consider the following statements about indifference curves:</b><br/><br/>1. Indifference curves are convex to the origin.<br/>2. Higher indifference curve represents higher level of satisfaction.<br/>3. Two indifference curves cut each other.<br/><b>Which of the statements given above is/are correct?</b>,NA,B,1 only,1 and 2,2 and 3,3 only,NA,NA,NA,NA,"<b>The correct answer is option 2, which states that both statements 1 and 2 are correct.</b><br/><br/>Let&#39;s analyze each statement to better understand them:<br/>Statement 1: Indifference curves are convex to the origin.<br/>Indifference curves are graphical representations of different combinations of two goods or services that provide the same level of utility or satisfaction to an individual. Convexity to the origin means that the indifference curve bends toward the origin, indicating that the individual prefers a combination with fewer goods or services. This is because the individual&#39;s marginal utility for each good generally decreases as they consume more of it.<br/>Statement 2: Higher indifference curve represents a higher level of satisfaction.<br/>Indifference curves are typically drawn with higher levels of satisfaction further away from the origin. This is because as an individual consumes more of both goods, their satisfaction increases. Therefore, a higher indifference curve represents a combination of goods that provides a higher level of satisfaction for the individual.<br/>Statement 3: Two indifference curves cut each other.<br/>This statement is incorrect. Indifference curves do not intersect or cut each other. Each indifference curve represents a specific level of satisfaction or utility, and higher indifference curves represent higher levels of satisfaction. ",NA

The Deccan Agriculturalists Relief Act of 1879 was enacted with which one of the following objectives?,NA,D,Restore lands to the dispossessed peasants,Ensure financial assistance to peasants during social and religious occasions,Restrict the sale of land for indebtedness to outsiders,Give legal aid to insolvent peasants,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The Deccan Agriculturalists Relief Act of 1879 was enacted with the objective of providing legal aid to insolvent peasants. This means that the act aimed to assist peasants who were unable to pay off their debts and were considered financially insolvent. The act provided legal support to these peasants, which likely included guidance and representation in legal matters related to their insolvency.<br/>Option 1, restoring lands to the dispossessed peasants, is not the primary objective of this act. While it is possible that some peasants may have lost their lands due to indebtedness, the act focuses on providing legal aid to insolvent peasants rather than restoring their lands.<br/>Option 2, ensuring financial assistance to peasants during social and religious occasions, is not mentioned as an objective of the act. The act specifically focuses on providing legal aid to insolvent peasants, rather than providing financial assistance for social and religious events.<br/>Option 3, restricting the sale of land for indebtedness to outsiders, is not the objective of the act. The act primarily aims to provide legal aid to insolvent peasants, rather than imposing restrictions on land sales.<br/><b>Therefore, option 4, giving legal aid to insolvent peasants, is the correct answer.</b>",NA
"When hot water is placed into an empty water bottle, the bottle keeps its shape and does not soften. What type of plastic is the water bottle made from?",NA,D,Thermoplastic,PVC,Polyurethane,Thermosetting,NA,NA,NA,NA," <b>correct answer is option 4, thermosetting plastic.</b><br/>When hot water is placed into an empty water bottle, the fact that the bottle keeps its shape and does not soften suggests that it is made from thermosetting plastic.<br/>Thermosetting plastics, also known as thermosets, are a type of polymer that undergoes a chemical reaction when heated and solidify into a permanent, rigid structure. This means that once they are set, they cannot be melted or reshaped. The process of heating thermosetting plastics causes cross-linking, which is the formation of strong chemical bonds between polymer chains.<br/>In contrast, thermoplastic plastics, like option 1, have a lower melting point and can be melted and reshaped multiple times without any chemical change. PVC (option 2) and polyurethane (option 3) are examples of thermoplastic materials.<br/><br/><b>Therefore, option 4, thermosetting plastic, is the correct answer because it explains why the hot water does not cause the water bottle to soften or lose its shape.</b>",NA
Which one of the following is not correct about Administrative Tribunals?,NA,C,The Parliament may by law constitute Administrative Tribunals both at the Union and State levels,Tribunals may look into disputes and complaints with respect to recruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed to public services.,Tribunals established by a law of the Parliament can exclude the jurisdiction of all Courts to allow for special leave to appeal.,The law establishing the Tribunals may provide for procedures including rules of evidence to be followed.,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Option 1 states that the Parliament has the authority to establish Administrative Tribunals at both the Union (central government) and State levels. This means that these tribunals can be created to deal with administrative and service-related disputes at different levels of government.<br/>Option 2 correctly states that Administrative Tribunals can handle disputes and complaints relating to the recruitment and conditions of service of individuals employed in public services. This includes matters such as appointments, promotions, transfers, and disciplinary actions.<br/>Option 3 states that Tribunals established by a law of the Parliament have the ability to exclude the jurisdiction of all Courts. This means that if a case falls under the jurisdiction of a specific Administrative Tribunal, then the normal courts would not have the authority to hear and decide on that case. This provision allows for a specialized forum for resolving administrative disputes.<br/>Option 4 states that the law establishing the Tribunals can also provide for the procedures to be followed, including the rules of evidence. This allows the Tribunals to have their own set of procedures and rules tailored to deal with administrative matters efficiently.<br/><br/><b>Therefore, option 3 is incorrect. It wrongly states that Tribunals can exclude the jurisdiction of all Courts to allow for special leave to appeal.</b>",NA

"For an ideal gas, which one of the following statements does not hold true?",NA,A,The speed of all gas molecules is same,The kinetic energies of all gas molecules are not same,The potential energy of the gas molecules is zero,There is no interactive force between the molecules.,NA,NA,NA,NA,"<b>For an ideal gas, the correct statement that does not hold true is option 1: <q>The speed of all gas molecules is the same.</q></b><br/><br/>In an ideal gas, the gas molecules are considered to be point particles with negligible volume and no intermolecular forces. However, the kinetic theory of gases states that gas molecules have a range of speeds. This means that the velocities of the gas molecules in an ideal gas are not all the same. Some gas molecules will have higher velocities, while others will have lower velocities. Consequently, the statement that the speed of all gas molecules is the same is not applicable to an ideal gas.<br/>Option 2 is correct because the kinetic energies of the gas molecules in an ideal gas are not all the same. Kinetic energy is directly proportional to the square of the velocity, so molecules with higher speeds will have higher kinetic energies.<br/>Option 3 is correct because the potential energy of gas molecules in an ideal gas is considered to be zero since there are no intermolecular forces.<br/>Option 4 is correct because ideal gases are assumed to have no interactive forces between the gas molecules.<br/>In summary, the statement that does not hold true for an ideal gas is that the speed of all gas molecules is the same.",NA
