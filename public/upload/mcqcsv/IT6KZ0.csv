"With reference to <q>water vapour</q> which of the following statements is/are correct?<br/>1. It is a gas, the amount of which decreases with altitude.<br/>2. Its percentage is maximum at the poles.<br/>Select the answer using the code given below:",NA,A,1 only,2 only,Both 1 and 2,Neither 1 nor 2,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is <q>Water vapor is a gas, and its amount decreases with altitude.</q> <br/>Hence, statement 1 is correct.<br/>The amount of water vapor generally decreases with altitude. This is because most of the water vapor originates from evaporation at the Earth&#39;s surface, especially from oceans, seas, lakes, and other water bodies.<br/>As you move higher in the atmosphere, the temperature decreases, and the capacity of air to hold water vapor also decreases.<br/>The percentage of water vapor is not maximum at the poles; it is minimum there. Hence, statement 2 is incorrect.<br/><br/><u>Water Vapor Concentration:</u> The concentration of water vapor is typically higher in warmer regions near the equator, where evaporation rates are highest due to higher temperatures. Conversely, polar regions, which are much colder, have lower evaporation rates and thus lower concentrations of water vapor.<br/><u>Maximum Percentage:</u> The percentage of water vapor is not maximum at the poles; it is actually minimum due to the cold temperatures and limited evaporation.",NA
"Consider the following statements :<br/>Statement-I: Thickness of the troposphere at the equator is much greater as compared to poles.<br/>Statement II: At the equator, heat is transported to great heights by strong convectional currents.<br/><br/>Which one of the following is correct in respect of the above statements?",NA,A,Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II explains Statement-I,"Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct, but Statement-II does not explain Statement-I","Statement-I is correct, but Statement-II is incorrect","Statement-I is incorrect, but Statement-II is correct",NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is Option 1.<br/>Key Points:<br/><br/>Statement-I: Thickness of the troposphere at the equator is much greater as compared to poles.<br/>Troposphere Thickness: The troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth&#39;s atmosphere, where most weather phenomena occur. Its thickness varies from about 8 km at the poles to about 18 km at the equator. Hence, statement 1 is correct.<br/>Reasons for Variation:<br/>Temperature: The equator receives more direct solar radiation, leading to higher surface temperatures. This causes the air to warm up, expand, and rise to greater heights.<br/>Convection: Strong convection currents at the equator push the warm air higher, increasing the troposphere&#39;s thickness.<br/><br/>Statement II: At the equator, heat is transported to great heights by strong convectional currents.<br/>Strong convectional currents at the equator transport heat to great heights, explaining the greater thickness of the troposphere in this region.  Hence statement 2 is correct.<br/>Convectional Currents: Convection is the process by which warm air rises and cool air sinks, creating a circulation pattern. At the equator, the intense solar heating causes strong convectional currents.<br/>Heat Transport: These strong convection currents transport heat from the surface to higher altitudes, contributing to the greater thickness of the troposphere in equatorial regions.<br/>Statement-II is the correct explanation for Statement-I: The strong convectional currents that transport heat to great heights at the equator are the reason for the greater thickness of the troposphere in this region.<br/>Therefore, the correct option is that both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is the correct explanation for Statement-I.",NA
Consider the following statements :<br/>Statement-I : The atmosphere is heated more by incoming solar radiation than by terrestrial radiation.<br/>Statement-II : Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are good absorbers of long wave radiation.<br/>Which one of the following is correct in respect of the above statements ?,NA,D,Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II explains Statement-I,"Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct, but Statement-II does not explain Statement-I","Statement-I is correct, but Statement-II is incorrect","Statement-I is incorrect, but Statement-II is correct.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"The Correct answer is Statement I is incorrect, but Statement II is correct.<br/><br/>Key Points:<br/>The primary mechanism of atmospheric heating is the absorption of terrestrial radiation by greenhouse gases, not the direct absorption of incoming solar radiation. Hence, statement 1 is incorrect.<br/>Incoming Solar Radiation (Short-Wave Radiation): The Sun emits energy primarily in the form of short-wave radiation, including visible light, ultraviolet light, and some infrared radiation. When this radiation reaches the Earth, a portion is reflected back into space by clouds, atmospheric particles, and the Earth&#39;s surface, while the rest is absorbed by the Earth&#39;s surface, warming it.<br/><br/>Terrestrial Radiation (Long-Wave Radiation): The Earth&#39;s surface, once warmed by the absorbed solar radiation, emits energy in the form of long-wave infrared radiation. This process is crucial because the Earth&#39;s surface is cooler than the Sun, so it emits energy at longer wavelengths.<br/><br/>Atmospheric Heating Mechanism: The atmosphere is relatively transparent to incoming short-wave solar radiation, meaning much of it passes through and reaches the Earth&#39;s surface.<br/>The Earth&#39;s surface absorbs this solar energy and then re-emits it as long-wave infrared radiation.<br/>The atmosphere contains greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO?), methane (CH?), water vapor (H?O), and others, which are good absorbers of long-wave radiation.<br/><br/>Primary Source of Atmospheric Heating: ?The atmosphere is heated more by the absorption of long-wave terrestrial radiation than by the direct absorption of incoming solar radiation. This re-emitted terrestrial radiation is absorbed by greenhouse gases, leading to the warming of the atmosphere through the greenhouse effect.<br/>Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are effective absorbers of long-wave radiation, contributing to the greenhouse effect and atmospheric warming. Hence, statement 2 is correct.<br/><br/>Greenhouse Gases: Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), water vapor (H<sub>2</sub>O), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). These gases have molecular structures that allow them to absorb and emit infrared radiation effectively.<br/><br/>Long-Wave Radiation: Long-wave radiation refers to the infrared radiation emitted by the Earth&#39;s surface as it cools. This radiation has longer wavelengths compared to the incoming solar radiation.<br/><br/>Absorption Mechanism: When the Earth&#39;s surface emits long-wave radiation, greenhouse gases absorb this energy. Upon absorbing the energy, the molecules of these gases become excited and then re-emit the radiation in all directions, including back toward the Earth&#39;s surface.<br/>This process traps heat in the atmosphere, creating a warming effect known as the greenhouse effect.<br/>Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are indeed effective absorbers of long-wave radiation, playing a crucial role in the warming of the atmosphere through the greenhouse effect.",NA
