Metallic character ____________ down a group,NA,C,decreases,remains the same in the group,Increases,None of these,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Explanation:<br/>Metallic character increases as you move down the periodic table. This is due to the fact that the electrons become easier to lose as the atomic radius increases. The increase in atomic radius decreases the strong electrostatic force of attraction between the positive nucleus and the negative electrons, causing the electrons to be held more loosely.",NA
