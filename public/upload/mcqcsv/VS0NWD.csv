Leave and hours of work: Workers may go on strike if they are not satisfied with their leave or hours of work. This is especially common in industries where workers are required to work long hours or where they are not given enough leave.

Workers may go on strike to protest retrenchment, and they may also demand higher wages and better working conditions in order to compensate for the loss of their jobs. For example, in 2020, employees of the Maruti Suzuki India went on strike protesting the retrenchment of 5000 employees.<br/><br/>It is important to note that these are just some of the most common causes of work stoppages in India. There are many other factors that can contribute to work stoppages, such as political instability, natural disasters, and economic recessions.",NA
