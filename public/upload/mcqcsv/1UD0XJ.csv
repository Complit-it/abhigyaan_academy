Limitation of powers: This means that the power of the government and its officials should be limited and restrained by laws that are written and enforceable. No one, including those in power, should be above the law. The principle of the separation of powers, where the legislative, executive and judiciary branches are separate and independent of each other, is also an important component of this feature.<br/><br/>2. Equality before law: This principle asserts that all people should be treated equally before the law, without discrimination or favoritism based on their race, gender, religion, social status, or any other characteristic. The legal system should provide equal protection and access to justice for all, and everyone should be subject to the same laws and procedures.<br/><br/>3. Protection of individual rights: This principle requires that individuals have certain rights and freedoms that are protected by law. This includes civil liberties such as freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and freedom of religion, as well as basic human rights such as the right to life, liberty, and property. The legal system should ensure that these rights are not violated or infringed upon by the government or any other person or entity.<br/><br/>4. Accountability and transparency: This principle requires that the government and its officials are accountable to the people they serve, and that their actions are transparent and open to scrutiny. This includes the principle of due process, where individuals are entitled to a fair and impartial legal process, as well as the right to access information and hold public officials accountable for their actions.<br/><br/>Based on these features, the correct answer is option 3: 1, 2 and 4 only. The third option includes all the main features of the <q>Rule of Law</q> except for the people&#39;s responsibility to the government, which is not considered a key feature. While citizens do have a responsibility to obey the law and contribute to society, the <q>Rule of Law</q> primarily focuses on the responsibilities of the government and its officials to uphold the law and protect individual rights.<br/><br/><b>NOTE:</b> It is worth noting that the <q>Rule of Law</q> is a complex and evolving concept that can be interpreted differently in different contexts and legal systems. Nonetheless, these main features provide a useful framework for understanding the basic principles that underpin this important concept.",NA

The Non-cooperation Movement in 1920 was withdrawn <u>because of the violence that erupted in Chauri Chaura.</u><br/><br/>The Non-cooperation Movement was launched by Mahatma Gandhi as a peaceful protest against British rule in India. It aimed to boycott British institutions, products, and laws and promote the use of Indian-made goods and the practice of Indian culture. However, in Chauri Chaura, a small town in Uttar Pradesh, violence broke out during a protest rally. A group of protesters attacked a police station, leading to the death of 22 policemen.<br/><br/>Gandhi, who was deeply committed to non-violence, was shocked by this incident. He believed that the movement had lost its nonviolent character and that it was no longer feasible to continue with the protests. As a result, he made the difficult decision to withdraw the Non-cooperation Movement, emphasizing the importance of maintaining peaceful methods of resistance. This decision was seen as a setback for the Indian independence movement, but it highlighted Gandhi&#39;s unwavering commitment to nonviolence as the means to achieve freedom.",NA
