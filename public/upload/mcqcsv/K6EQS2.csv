"The tissue composed of the living, thin-walled, polyhedral cell",NA,B,collenchyma,parenchyma,sclerenchyma,striated muscle,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is parenchyma.<br/>Explanation: <br/>Parenchyma is a type of plant tissue, an important and versatile tissue in plants, contributing to their growth, development, and survival. It is composed of living cells that have thin walls and a polyhedral shape. This tissue is responsible for various functions, such as storage, photosynthesis, and secretion. <br/>Parenchyma tissue is found in various parts of plants, including leaves, stems, roots, and fruits. It is made up of relatively unspecialized cells that have thin cell walls and large intracellular spaces. <br/>The cells of parenchyma tissue are often responsible for carrying out metabolic activities, such as photosynthesis in the case of parenchyma cells in leaves. <br/>Parenchyma tissue can also be involved in storage functions, storing nutrients and water. The thin walls and polyhedral shape of the cells allow for efficient exchange of gases and nutrients.",NA
Each neuron has a single long part called:,NA,B,dendrite,axon,cell body,cytoplasm,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Answer: The single long part of a neuron is called the axon. The axon is responsible for transmitting electrical signals away from the neuron&#39;s cell body to other neurons, muscles, or glands. <br/>Axon: - The axon is a long, slender extension of a neuron that carries electrical signals away from the cell body. <br/>- It is covered by a fatty substance called myelin, which helps to insulate and speed up the transmission of signals. <br/>- Axons can vary in length, with some reaching up to several feet in the human body. <br/>In summary, while each part of a neuron plays a crucial role in its functioning, the single long part responsible for transmitting signals away from the cell body is the axon.",NA
"Cells with evenly thickened, hard, lignified walls are seen in:",NA,B,collenchyma,sclerenchyma,striated muscle cells,parenchyma,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Cells with evenly thickened, hard, lignified walls are seen in sclerenchyma. <br/>Sclerenchyma is a type of plant tissue that provides support and strength to the plant. It is characterized by thickened, hard, and lignified cell walls. These cell walls contain a substance called lignin, which makes them tough and rigid. <br/>Key points:<br/>- Sclerenchyma cells have evenly thickened cell walls, unlike other types of plant cells. <br/>- The thickening of the cell walls is due to the deposition of lignin, a complex polymer. <br/>- Lignified cell walls provide strength and support to the plant, allowing it to withstand mechanical stress. <br/>- Sclerenchyma cells are dead at maturity and lack protoplasts. <br/>- They are found in various parts of the plant, such as the stems, roots, and seed coats.",NA
"Two slides of plant tissues, parenchyma and sclerenchyma, are shown to you. You can identify the sclerenchyma by the:",NA,D,position of nucleus,size of the cell,location of nucleus,thickness of cell wall,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Answer: <br/>The sclerenchyma can be identified by the thickness of its cell wall. The cell wall of sclerenchyma cells is significantly thicker than that of parenchyma cells. <br/><br/>Explanation: <br/>To differentiate between parenchyma and sclerenchyma tissues, you need to examine the characteristics of the cell wall. The cell wall of sclerenchyma cells is composed of lignin, which makes it thick and rigid. On the other hand, the cell wall of parenchyma cells is thin and flexible.",NA

The shape of striated muscle cells is: ,NA,B,spindle-shaped,cylindrical,elongated with tapering ends,spherical,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The shape of striated muscle cells is cylindrical. <br/>-Striated muscle cells are long and cylindrical in shape.<br/>-They have a uniform diameter along their length.<br/>-Their ends are not tapered or pointed. <br/>-These cells are also known as skeletal muscle cells. <br/>-They are multinucleated, meaning they have multiple nuclei. <br/>-The nuclei are located on the periphery of the cell, just beneath the cell membrane. <br/>-Each striated muscle cell is composed of myofibrils, which are responsible for muscle contraction. <br/>-These myofibrils give the cell its striated or striped appearance. <br/>-The cylindrical shape of striated muscle cells allows for efficient force generation and transmission during muscle contraction. <br/>-These cells are typically attached to tendons, which connect them to bones and allow for movement.",NA
Branched muscle fibres interconnected by oblique bridges are:,NA,C,unstriated muscle fibres,striated muscle,cardiac muscle fibres,skeletal muscle fibres,NA,NA,NA,NA,Correct answer is C: Cardiac Muscle Fibers. <br/>Explanation: <br/>C. Cardiac muscle fibers: - Cardiac muscle fibers make up the walls of the heart and are responsible for involuntary contractions. <br/>- They are branched and interconnected by oblique bridges called intercalated discs. <br/>- Cardiac muscle fibers fit the description mentioned in the question. They are branched muscle fibers interconnected by oblique bridges.,NA
Plant cells with thickened walls at corners and non-lignified cell walls are seen in:,NA,B,Parenchyma,Collenchyma,Aerenchyma,Epidermal cell,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Plant cells with thickened walls at corners and non-lignified cell walls are seen in collenchyma. <br/>Collenchyma cells are a type of ground tissue found in plants. They have a thickened primary cell wall, particularly at the corners, which provides support and flexibility to the plant. The cell walls of collenchyma cells are primarily made up of cellulose and pectin, and they lack lignin, which is responsible for the hardening and lignification of cell walls. <br/> The key characteristics of collenchyma cells in plants are: thickened walls at corners, Non-lignified cell walls, and Support and Flexibility.",NA
