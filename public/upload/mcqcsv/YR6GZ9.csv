Which one of the following elements is used as a timekeeper in atomic clocks?,NA,B,Potassium,Caesium,Calcium,Magnesium,NA,NA,NA,NA,"<b>The correct answer is option 2 - Caesium.</b><br/> Atomic clocks are devices that measure time based on the oscillations of atoms. In particular, caesium atomic clocks are used as timekeepers.<br/>Caesium is used because it has a very precise natural frequency of oscillation. In atomic clocks, caesium atoms are excited to a specific energy level and then allowed to return to their ground state. The time it takes for the caesium atoms to complete this cycle is used as a reference for measuring time.<br/>It is important to note that other elements such as potassium, calcium, and magnesium are not typically used as timekeepers in atomic clocks. While they may have other valuable uses and applications, their natural frequencies of oscillation are not as precise as caesium.<br/><br/><b>In summary, option 2 - Caesium is the correct answer because it is specifically used as a timekeeper in atomic clocks due to its precise natural frequency of oscillation.</b>",NA
Which one of the following elements is involved in the control of water content of the blood?,NA,A,Potassium,Lithium,Rubidium,Caesium,NA,NA,NA,NA,"<b>The correct answer is option 1: Potassium. </b><br/>Potassium is involved in the control of water content in the blood. It is an essential mineral that plays a crucial role in maintaining proper hydration in the body.<br/>Potassium helps regulate the balance of fluids and electrolytes in the body by controlling the movement of water into and out of cells. It acts as an electrolyte, which means it carries an electric charge and helps conduct electrical impulses in the body. This includes the movement of water across cell membranes.<br/>When potassium levels are too high in the blood, it can cause dehydration because excess potassium draws water out of cells, leading to increased urine production. On the other hand, low potassium levels can disrupt the body`s fluid balance and lead to water retention and swelling.<br/><br/>It&#39;s important to note that while lithium, rubidium, and caesium are chemical elements, they are not directly involved in the control of water content in the blood. Therefore, options 2, 3, and 4 are incorrect.",NA
Which one of the following gases dissolves in water to give acidic solution?,NA,A,Carbon dioxide,Oxygen,Nitrogen,Nitrogen,NA,NA,NA,NA,"<b>The correct answer is option 1, carbon dioxide.</b><br/><br/>When carbon dioxide dissolves in water, it forms carbonic acid. This happens because carbon dioxide reacts with water to produce carbonic acid, which is a weak acid. The equation for this reaction is: CO2 + H2O [REPLACEMENT] H2CO3.<br/>Carbonic acid releases hydrogen ions (H+) when it dissociates in water, making the solution acidic. The presence of hydrogen ions gives the solution a sour taste and allows it to conduct electricity.<br/>Option 2, oxygen, does not dissolve to form an acidic solution. It is a non-reactive gas and does not undergo significant chemical reactions with water.<br/>Option 3, nitrogen, also does not dissolve in water to form an acidic solution. Nitrogen is an inert gas and does not react with water.<br/>Option 4, hydrogen, can dissolve in water to form a solution, but it does not give an acidic solution. Hydrogen gas dissolves to form a neutral solution.<br/><br/><b>Therefore, the correct answer is option 1, carbon dioxide, as it dissolves in water to give an acidic solution.</b>",NA

Why is argon gas used along with tungsten wire in an electric bulb?,NA,A,To increase the life of the bulb,To reduce the consumption of electricity,To make the emitted light colored,To reduce the cost of the bulb,NA,NA,NA,NA,"<b>The correct answer is option-1: To increase the life of the bulb.</b><br/><br/>When tungsten wire is heated to a high temperature, it emits visible light. However, at higher temperatures, tungsten wire tends to evaporate and degrade over time. This reduces the lifespan of the bulb.<br/>Argon gas is used in an electric bulb to address this issue and increase the longevity of the bulb. The gas is inert, meaning it does not react easily with other chemicals. By filling the bulb with argon gas, it creates an environment that reduces the evaporation of the tungsten wire. This helps to maintain the integrity of the wire and prolong the lifespan of the bulb.<br/>In addition to extending the lifespan of the bulb, the use of argon gas also helps to stabilize the emitted light. It prevents the tungsten wire from oxidizing and keeps the filament from deteriorating, thus reducing the risk of the bulb going out due to filament failure.<br/><br/><b>Therefore, argon gas is used with tungsten wire in an electric bulb to increase its lifespan and ensure a more stable and consistent light output.</b>",NA
Which one of the following is the correct relation between the Kelvin temperature (T) and the Celsius temperature (tc)?,NA,D,These are two independent temperature scales,T = tc,T = tc - 273 • 15,T = tc +273-15,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Option 1 states that Kelvin temperature (T) and Celsius temperature (tc) are two independent temperature scales. This means that they do not have any relationship between them. However, this is not correct. Kelvin and Celsius scales are interrelated.<br/>Option 2 states that T = tc, suggesting that Kelvin temperature is equal to Celsius temperature. This is also incorrect because Kelvin and Celsius scales have different zero points and thus, they cannot be equal.<br/>Option 3 states that T = tc - 273 • 15. This equation is incorrect as it multiplies 273 with 15, which is not the correct conversion factor between Kelvin and Celsius scales.<br/>Option 4 states that T = tc +273-15. This is the correct relationship between Kelvin and Celsius temperatures. To convert Celsius temperature to Kelvin, we need to add 273. And as the Celsius scale has a 0 point 15 degrees lower than the Kelvin scale, we subtract 15 from the Celsius temperature.<br/><br/><b>In conclusion, option 4 is the correct relation between Kelvin and Celsius temperature.</b>",NA
Sound waves cannot travel through a,NA,D,copper wire placed in air,silver slab placed in air,glass prism placed in water,wooden hollow pipe placed in vacuum,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The question asks about which medium sound waves cannot travel through. Let&#39;s analyze each option to understand why the correct answer is option 4.<br/>Option 1 suggests a copper wire placed in air. Sound waves can travel through solids, liquids, and gases. Copper is a solid, and air is a gas, so sound waves can travel through the copper wire and air without any problem. Therefore, option 1 is incorrect.<br/>Option 2 mentions a silver slab placed in air. Similar to the previous explanation, sound waves can travel through solids and gases. Since both silver and air are solids, sound waves can travel through them. Therefore, option 2 is incorrect.<br/>Option 3 discusses a glass prism placed in water. Sound waves can travel through solids, liquids, and gases. Both glass (solid) and water (liquid) allow sound waves to propagate. Therefore, option 3 is incorrect.<br/>Option 4 presents a wooden hollow pipe placed in a vacuum. Sound waves require a medium to propagate, and a vacuum is an absence of any medium. As a result, sound waves cannot travel through a vacuum. Therefore, the correct answer is option 4.<br/><br/><b>In conclusion, sound waves cannot travel through a wooden hollow pipe placed in a vacuum because a vacuum lacks a medium</b>",NA

"<b>Consider the following statements :</b><br/><br/>1. There is no net moment on a body which is in equilibrium.<br/>2. The momentum of a body is always conserved.<br/>3. The kinetic energy of an object is always conserved.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?",NA,C,"1, 2 and 3",2 and 3 only,1 and 2 only,1 only,NA,NA,NA,NA,"<b>The correct answer is option 3, which states that statements 1 and 2 only are correct. Let&#39;s dissect each statement to understand why this is the correct answer.</b><br/><br/>Statement 1: <q>There is no net moment on a body which is in equilibrium.</q> This statement is true. In physics, equilibrium refers to a state where an object`s net force and net torque are both zero. In this state, there is no change in the object`s linear or angular motion, meaning there is no net moment acting on it.<br/>Statement 2: <q>The momentum of a body is always conserved.</q> This statement is incorrect. Conservation of momentum is a fundamental principle in physics, stating that the total momentum of an isolated system remains constant if no external forces act on it. However, in the presence of external forces, the momentum of a body can change. Therefore, momentum is not always conserved.<br/>Statement 3: <q>The kinetic energy of an object is always conserved.</q> This statement is also incorrect. Kinetic energy, which is the energy possessed by an object due to its motion, is not always conserved. It can change due to work done by external forces, such as friction or air resistance.<br/><b>In summary, statement 1 is correct, statement 2</b>",NA

While magnetic effect and chemical effect of the current can have some influence on certain electrical components, they are not directly related to the functioning of safety fuses.<br/>Option 2, which includes options 1, 2, and 3, is also incorrect. Again, the magnetic effect of the current and the chemical effect of the current are not relevant to the working of safety fuses.<br/>Option 3 correctly identifies the two factors on which the working of safety fuses depends: the magnitude of the current and the heating effect of the current. Safety fuses protect electrical circuits from excessive currents that can cause damage, and they operate by melting a fuse wire when the current exceeds a certain threshold. This melting occurs due to the heating effect of the current, thereby breaking the circuit and preventing further damage.<br/><br/><b>Option 4, which states that the working of safety fuses depends only on the heating effect of the current, is incorrect. The magnitude of the current also plays a crucial role in the operation of safety fuses.</b>",NA

In which one of the following types of connective tissues in animals does fat get stored?,NA,A,Adipocyte,Chondrocyte,Osteocyte,Reticulocyte,NA,NA,NA,NA,"<b>The correct answer is option 1, Adipocyte.</b><br/> Adipocytes are specialized cells found in adipose tissue, which is a type of connective tissue that functions to store fat. Adipose tissue is primarily composed of adipocytes, which contain large lipid droplets that store triglycerides, a type of fat molecule. These lipid droplets give adipose tissue its characteristic appearance of being <q>fatty</q> or <q>fluffy</q>. Adipose tissue is found throughout the body, particularly beneath the skin, around organs, and in bone marrow. It serves important functions such as insulation, cushioning, and energy storage. Adipocytes are unique in their ability to expand and shrink in size depending on the amount of fat stored. When the body takes in excess calories, adipocytes store the excess energy as fat. Conversely, when the body requires energy, adipocytes release these stored fat molecules to be used by other cells. This process plays a crucial role in maintaining energy balance and is regulated by various hormones and factors. Therefore, the correct answer is adipocyte.",NA
