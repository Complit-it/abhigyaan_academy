In the case of personal income tax, it can act as an automatic stabilizer as it is directly linked to individuals&#39; income levels. When the economy is facing a downturn and incomes decrease, individuals&#39; tax payments also decrease, providing them with more disposable income. This increased disposable income can then be used to stimulate consumption and boost economic activity. On the other hand, during an economic upswing, incomes increase, leading to higher tax payments and reducing disposable income. This helps to moderate excessive economic growth and prevent inflationary pressures. Therefore, personal income tax acts as an automatic stabilizer as it adjusts to the changing economic conditions, helping to smooth out fluctuations in the economy.",NA

In a repo operation, the interest rate isn&#39;t a variable part of the loan contract, rather it is set by the central bank independently and used uniformly in all transactions it conducts with the commercial banks.<br/><br/>Option 4 is potentially misleading: while the repo rate does factor in the cost of collateral security in an indirect way, describing it as <q>the cost of collateral security</q> isn&#39;t entirely accurate. It&#39;s better to think of it as the overnight interest rate charged by Central Bank, collateralized against government securities.",NA
