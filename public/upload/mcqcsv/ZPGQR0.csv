Fear of eating up all the available plant and animal resources if stayed at one place: Hunter-gatherer societies relied on the availability of plants and animals for their sustenance. If they stayed in one place for a prolonged period, they would deplete the local resources, making it difficult to survive. Therefore, they moved from place to place to ensure a sustainable supply of food. <br/>2. Because animals to be hunted move from place to place: Animals, being mobile, often migrate or move from one location to another in search of food, water, or suitable habitats. Hunter-gatherers had to follow these animal movements to effectively hunt and secure their food source. This necessitated their nomadic lifestyle. <br/>3. Plants and trees bear fruit in different seasons: Different plants and trees have varying fruiting seasons. To gather a variety of fruits and nuts, hunter-gatherers needed to move to different locations at different times of the year. By moving to areas where specific plants were in season, they could ensure a diverse and consistent food supply. <br/><br/>Overall, all three statements provide valid reasons for why hunter-gatherers moved from place to place in ancient times.",NA
The man transitioned from the food-gathering stage to the food-producing stage in the,NA,A,Neolithic Age,Mesolithic Age,Charcolithic Age,Palaeolithic Age,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The Correct Answer is A: Neolithic Age <br/>Neolithic Age: The Transition to Food Production <br/>The transition from the food-gathering stage, where early humans relied solely on hunting and gathering, to the food-producing stage, where they began to cultivate crops and domesticate animals, is attributed to the Neolithic Age. Here&#39;s why: <br/>- Introduction of Agriculture: The Neolithic Age, which roughly spans from 10,000 BCE to 3,000 BCE, saw the advent of agriculture. This period is often referred to as the New Stone Age, and it was during this time that humans began to grow their own food, leading to a shift from nomadic hunting and gathering to settled agricultural communities. <br/>- Domestication of Animals: Alongside the cultivation of crops, the Neolithic Age also marked the beginning of animal domestication. Early humans began to raise and breed animals for food, labor, and other uses. This not only provided a steady source of food but also allowed for the development of new, more settled lifestyles. <br/>- Settlements and Societies: With the advent of food production, humans were able to settle in one place, leading to the formation of villages and eventually larger societies. This was a significant shift from the previous Mesolithic Age, where humans lived in small, nomadic groups. <br/>- Technological Innovations: The transition to food production brought about significant technological and cultural changes. Innovations in tool-making, such as the creation of more sophisticated stone tools, pottery, and weaving, became possible because people had more time to devote to tasks other than food procurement. <br/>In conclusion, the Neolithic Age marked a significant turning point in human history, as it was during this time that humans transitioned from a lifestyle of hunting and gathering to one of agriculture and settlement, laying the foundation for the rise of civilizations.",NA

This is primarily because these caves contain a rich collection of archaeological findings.<br/>The site has yielded tools and implements from all these periods, providing concrete evidence of human evolution and progress in tool-making techniques and survival strategies.<br/>The artifacts found here include tools from the Old Stone Age (Lower Palaeolithic), tools from the Middle Stone Age (Mesolithic), as well as tools from the New Stone Age (Chalcolithic). <br/>This shows a clear progression and continuity of human activities and evolution over a long period of time, which is why statement 1 is correct. <br/><br/>2. Presence of Shankhalipi Inscriptions:<br/>While the Bhimbetka caves do contain ancient inscriptions, the presence of ""Shankhalipi"" inscriptions specifically is not a significant factor in demonstrating the continuity of human evolution from the Lower Paleolithic period to the Mesolithic period to the Chalcolithic period. <br/>Shankhalipi, also known as shell-script, is a unique and lesser-known script found in India, and it is not associated with the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, or Chalcolithic periods. <br/>Therefore, the presence of Shankhalipi inscriptions in the Bhimbetka caves does not directly support the evidence of continuity of human evolution over these periods. This is why statement 2 is not correct.<br/>So, the correct answer to the question is option A: 1 only.",NA
The metal central to this age finds frequent mention in the Vedas and the age itself follows after the Chalcolithic Age. It can be,NA,B,Palaeolithic Age,Iron Age,Copper-stone Age,Later Stone Age,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The Correct Option is D: Iron Age<br/><br/>Explanation of the Iron Age<br/>The Iron Age is a historical period that follows the Chalcolithic or Copper-Stone Age. This age is characterized by the widespread use of iron or steel. <br/><br/>Significance of Iron<br/>Iron, the metal central to this age, is mentioned frequently in the Vedas, ancient Indian scriptures. The Vedas describe its use in various tools, weapons, and ceremonial items. <br/>Iron's prevalence during this age indicates a shift in human society and technology. The discovery and mastering of iron smelting (the process of extracting iron from its ore) allowed for significant advancements in tool and weapon production. <br/><br/>Transition from Chalcolithic Age <br/>The Iron Age follows the Chalcolithic or Copper-Stone Age in the three-age system, a system of classifying archaeological periods into Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. This system is often used in human prehistory and protohistory. <br/>The transition from the Chalcolithic Age to Iron Age is marked by the change in the material used for making tools and weapons, from copper and stone to iron.<br/><br/> Features of the Iron Age<br/>The Iron Age is not a specific period that occurred at the same time worldwide. Instead, its onset varies depending on geographical location and cultural context. For instance, Iron Age in the Middle East began around 1200 BC, while in India, it started around 1200 to 1000 BC. <br/>During the Iron Age, societies were typically organized into city-states or kingdoms. There was a marked increase in the complexity of social structures, trade networks, and warfare tactics. <br/>In terms of art and culture, the Iron Age saw the rise of literate civilizations, the spread of alphabetic scripts, and the development of philosophical and religious thoughts. <br/><br/>Why not the other options?<br/>The Palaeolithic Age, Copper-Stone Age, and Later Stone Age are not the correct answers because these periods are characterized by the use of stone and copper for tool production, not iron.",NA
Consider the following major archaeological sites ranging from the Mesolithic Age to the Iron Age in the Indian subcontinent. Match them with their respective regions in the present- day India: <br/>1. Koldihwa: Madhya Pradesh <br/>2. Mehrgarh: Haryana <br/>3. Paiyampalli: Tamil Nadu<br/>Select the correct answer using the codes below.,NA,B,1 and 2 only,3 only,2 and 3 only,1 only,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The Correct Answer is B : 3 only <br/><br/>Explanation:<br/><br/>The archaeological sites and their respective regions in present-day India are: <br/>Koldihwa: This is an archaeological site dating back to the Mesolithic Age. It is located in the present-day Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, and not Madhya Pradesh. This site is notable for its evidence of early farming communities in the Indian subcontinent.<br/>Mehrgarh: This site is one of the earliest sites with evidence of an agricultural and herding society in the world. However, Mehrgarh is located in the Balochistan province of Pakistan, not Haryana in India. The site is significant for understanding the Neolithic and early Bronze Age periods of the Indian subcontinent. <br/>Paiyampalli: This is an archaeological site located in the present-day Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is known for its Mesolithic and Neolithic artifacts. This site is unique for its evidence of prehistoric human activity in the southern part of the Indian subcontinent. <br/>So, the correct option is B: 3 only, as Paiyampalli is the only site that is correctly matched to its location in present-day India.",NA
The beginning of agriculture can be ascribed most suitably to which of these times?,NA,C,2500 years ago with the onset of the Magadha empire,4700 years ago with the appearance of the first cities on the Indus,Nearly 8000-10000 years ago.,About 25000 years ago in the first Penistone glacial period,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The Correct Answer is C: Nearly 8000-10000 years ago. <br/><br/>Origins of Agriculture<br/>The beginning of agriculture can be traced back to nearly 8000-10000 years ago. This period is referred to as the Neolithic Revolution, a time when humans transitioned from being nomadic hunter-gatherers to settled farmers.<br/><br/>Reasons for the Neolithic Revolution <br/>The shift towards agriculture was driven by a combination of environmental changes and the need for a more reliable food source. As the climate became warmer and more stable, it became possible for humans to stay in one place and cultivate crops. <br/>Moreover, the growth of human population demanded a steady food source. Hunting and gathering could no longer sustain larger groups of people, leading to the need for domestication of plants and animals. <br/><br/>Agriculture and Civilization <br/>The development of agriculture laid the foundation for the emergence of human civilizations. With a stable source of food, people were able to form permanent settlements, which eventually grew into villages, towns, and cities. The surplus food produced through farming allowed for the specialization of labor. Not everyone had to be involved in food production, freeing people to take up other roles such as artisans, priests, and warriors. This led to the development of complex societies and cultures. <br/><br/>Later Developments<br/>The onset of the Magadha empire (around 2500 years ago) or the appearance of the first cities on the Indus (around 4700 years ago) were significant periods in human history, but agriculture had already been established by these times. <br/>Similarly, the first Penistone glacial period (around 25000 years ago) predates the development of agriculture. During this time, humans were primarily hunter-gatherers. <br/>So, the most suitable ascription for the beginning of agriculture would be nearly 8000-10000 years ago.",NA
Which among the following sites provide the earliest evidence of settled agriculture in the Indian subcontinent?,NA,D,Dholavira,Inam Ghar,Kalibangan,Mehrgarh,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The Correct Answer is D: Mehargarh <br/>Earliest Evidence of Settled Agriculture in the Indian Subcontinent: Mehrgarh <br/><br/>Overview:<br/>Mehrgarh, located in present-day Balochistan, Pakistan, provides the earliest evidence of settled agriculture in the Indian subcontinent. It dates back to the Neolithic era, around 7000 BCE, before the advent of the Indus Valley Civilization. <br/><br/>Agricultural Practices:<br/>Evidence of farming in Mehrgarh includes remnants of wheat and barley, along with the tools used to grow and harvest these crops. Archeologists have also found evidence of the domestication of animals such as cows, goats, and sheep.<br/><br/>Settlements and Lifestyle:<br/>The people of Mehrgarh lived in mud-brick houses that were often re-plastered. They stored their grain in granaries, indicating a surplus from agriculture. They also practiced pottery and metallurgy, suggesting an advanced level of civilization for that time.<br/><br/>Comparison with Other Sites:<br/>While Dholavira, Inam Ghar, and Kalibangan are significant archaeological sites related to the Indus Valley Civilization, they do not predate Mehrgarh in terms of evidence for settled agriculture. These sites emerged later, around 2600 BCE, and while they display advanced urban planning and sophisticated craftsmanship, Mehrgarh remains the earliest known site for settled agriculture.",NA
