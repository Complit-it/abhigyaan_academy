Hence option 4 is correct.<br/>- The maximum temperature occurs in the afternoon.<br/>- The average temperature on the Earth will be around 14&deg;C.",NA
Which part of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) causes human skin cancer?,NA,B,Gamma rays,Ultraviolet radiation,Micro waves,None of the above,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The electromagnetic spectrum is a continuum of all electromagnetic waves arranged according to frequency and wavelength. The electromagnetic spectrum includes, from longest wavelength to shortest: radio waves, microwaves, infrared, optical, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma-rays. Among these waves, Ultraviolet radiation causes human skin cancer. <br/><br/>KEY POINT: <br/>Ultraviolet radiation:<br/>-UV radiation is part of the natural energy produced by the sun.<br/>- On the electromagnetic spectrum, UV light has shorter wavelengths than visible light, so your eyes can&#39;t see UV, but your skin can feel it.<br/>Tanning beds also emit UV radiation.<br/>Two types of UV light are proven to contribute to the risk for skin cancer:<br/>-Ultraviolet A (UVA) has a longer wavelength and is associated with skin aging.<br/>- Ultraviolet B (UVB) has a shorter wavelength and is associated with skin burning.<br/>- While UVA and UVB rays differ in how they affect the skin, they both do harm.<br/>- Unprotected exposure to UVA and UVB damages the DNA in skin cells, producing genetic defects, or mutations, that can lead to skin cancer (as well as premature aging.)<br/>- These rays can also cause eye damage, including cataracts and eyelid cancers.<br/><br/>Hence, Ultraviolet radiation is the correct answer.",NA
What causes the variation in temperature across different latitudes on Earth?,NA,C,The rotation of the Earth on its axis.,The distance of a location from the Moon.,The tilt of the Earth&#39;s axis relative to its orbit around the Sun.,None of the above,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is The tilt of the Earth&#39;s axis relative to its orbit around the Sun.<br/><br/><b>Key Points:</b><br/>The primary factor influencing temperature variations across latitudes is the amount of solar radiation received.<br/>Near the equator, where the Sun&#39;s rays strike the Earth most directly, temperatures are generally warmer. <br/>The angle at which sunlight strikes the Earth&#39;s surface varies with latitude.<br/>Near the equator, sunlight strikes the surface at a more direct angle, leading to greater heating.<br/>Another factor influencing temperature variations is the length of daylight hours.<br/>- Near the poles, especially during the polar summer, daylight can last for extended periods, leading to more heating.<br/>- In contrast, during the polar winter, there may be extended periods of darkness, resulting in cooling.<br/>- The reflectivity of the Earth&#39;s surface, known as albedo, also affects temperature variations.<br/>Surfaces with high albedo, such as ice and snow, reflect more sunlight and absorb less heat, leading to cooler temperatures.",NA

Which one of the following is the most important factor that influences the distribution of temperature on the earth?,NA,A,Insolation,Solar radiation,Terrestrial radiation,Distance from sea,NA,NA,NA,NA,The concept of Insolation:<br/><br/>- Insolation is the most important factor that influences the distribution of temperature on the earth.<br/>- Insolation is the solar radiation that reaches the earth&#39;s surface.<br/>- It is measured by the amount of solar energy received per square centimeter per minute.<br/>- The factor that determines the amount of insolation received is the angle of inclination of the rays.<br/>- This depends on the latitude of a place.<br/>- The higher the latitude the less is the angle they make with the surface of the earth resulting in slant sun rays.<br/>- The area covered by vertical rays is always less than the slant rays.,NA
In which of the following places is the difference between the day and night temperatures likely to be the highest?,NA,C,Chilika Lake,Andaman and Nicobar Islands,Thar Desert,Mount Everest,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Important Points: <br/>-The difference between the day and night temperature is likely to be the highest in the Thar desert.<br/>- In the Thar Desert, the day temperature may rise to 50&deg;C, and drop down to near 15&deg;C the same night.<br/>- On the other hand, there is hardly any difference in day and night temperatures in the Andaman and Nicobar islands or in Kerala.<br/>- The Great Indian Desert, well-known as the Thar Desert, is a large and arid region in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent.<br/>- It is the world&#39;s 17th-largest desert and the world&#39;s 9th-largest hot subtropical desert.<br/>- The Great Indian Desert lies between the Aravalli Hills in the northeast and stretches to Punjab and Haryana to the north, to the Rann of Kutch along the western coast, and the alluvial plains of the Indus River in the northwest.<br/><br/>Additional Information:<br/>- The main reason for the stark temperature change is that desert air is extremely dry. In arid deserts like the Sahara and the Atacama Desert in Chile, the humidity - the amount of water vapor in the air - is practically zero, and unlike sand, water has a huge capacity to store heat.<br/>- Water vapor in the air traps heat close to the ground like a giant invisible blanket  and stops it from dissipating into the atmosphere, according to World Atlas.<br/>- Air with high humidity also requires more energy to heat up, meaning it also takes more time for that energy to dissipate and for the surroundings to cool down.<br/>- Therefore, the lack of humidity in deserts allows these arid places to quickly heat up but also rapidly cool.",NA
Consider the following statements:<br/>1. High clouds primarily reflect solar radiation and cool the surface of the Earth.<br/>2. Low clouds have a high absorption of infrared radiation emanating from the Earth&#39;s surface and thus cause warming effect.<br/>Which of the statements given above is/are correct?,NA,D,1 only,2 only,Both 1 and 2,Neither 1 nor 2,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is Neither 1 nor 2.<br/><br/>Key Points:<br/>Difference between High Clouds and Low Clouds<br/><br/>-High clouds are often thin and do not reflect very much. They let lots of the Sun&#39;s warmth in. Low clouds are often quite thick and reflect lots of sunlight back into space.<br/>-The main difference between high and low clouds is that the high clouds are colder. This means that they radiate less energy into space than the lower, warmer clouds. Therefore, high clouds work to <q>trap</q> more energy than low clouds.<br/>- High clouds are not good at reflecting short waves. But, they are very good at blocking long waves. This also traps heat. Thus, high clouds will cause a warming of the Earth&#39;s surface. Hence, Statement 2 is not correct.<br/>- Low clouds are excellent reflectors. But, they don&#39;t stop the longwave energy from escaping to space. Therefore, low clouds help to cool the Earth. Hence, Statement 1 is not correct.",NA
The transfer of heat energy through the movement of a mass of substance from one place to another place is called ______.,NA,B,Conduction,Convection,Condensation,Radiation,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Heat may be transferred via any substance made up of atoms and molecules.<br/><br/>Important Points:<br/>-The process of heat transmission through the bulk movement of molecules inside fluids such as gases and liquids is known as convection.<br/>-Thermal epansion occurs when a fluid is heated from below. The fluid&#39;s density decreases.<br/>- Colder fluid is denser, as we all know. The less-dense, hotter section of the fluid rises due to buoyancy.<br/>- It is replaced with a cooler, denser fluid. When this component heats up and rises to be replaced by the cooler top layer, the process is repeated.<br/>- Convection is used to transmit heat in this way.<br/><br/>Additional Information:<br/>Conduction: When there is a difference in temperature potential between contiguous locations, heat is directly conveyed through the material of a substance without the material moving.<br/>Radiation: Ionization is caused by the release of energy as electromagnetic waves or moving subatomic particles, particularly high-energy particles. <br/>Condensation: The process by which the physical state of matter transitions from gaseous to liquid is known as condensation.<br/>Therefore, the transfer of heat energy through the movement of a mass of a substance from one place to another place is called Convection.",NA

Consider the following statements with respect to temperature distribution in the oceans:<br/>1. The highest surface oceanic temperature is recorded at the equator.<br/>2. The temperature decreases at a uniform rate with increasing oceanic depth.<br/>3. The oceans in the northern hemisphere record relatively higher temperatures than in the southern hemisphere.<br/>How many of the statements given above are correct?,NA,A,Only one,Only two,All three,None,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Important Points: <br/><br/>- The maximum temperature of the oceans is always at their surfaces because they directly receive the heat from the sun and the heat is transmitted to the lower sections of the oceans through the process of conduction. It results in a decrease of temperature with the increasing depth, but the rate of decrease is not uniform throughout. The temperature structure of oceans can be described as a three-layer system.<br/>- The first layer (Top layer) is about 500m thick with temperatures ranging between 20 to 25&#39;C.<br/>- The second layer (Thermocline) is characterised by a rapid decrease in temperature with increasing depth. It is about 500m-1000m thick.<br/>- the Third layer is very cold and extends up to the deep ocean floor. Here temperature change with the depth is very slight. Hence statement B is Incorrect.<br/>- The average temperature of surface water of the oceans is about 27&deg;C and it gradually decreases from the equator towards the poles. The oceans in the northern hemisphere record relatively higher temperature than in the southern hemisphere.<br/>- The highest temperature is not recorded at the equator but slightly towards the north of it. The average annual temperatures for the northern and southern hemisphere are around 19 &deg;C and 16 &deg;C respectively. This variation is due to the unequal distribution of land and water in the northern and southern hemispheres. Hence option A is Incorrect and option C is the correct answer.",NA

Ocean waters get heated up by solar energy just as land. The process of heating and cooling oceanic water is slower than land. <br/><b>Factors Affecting Temperature Distribution</b><br/>- <u>Latitude:</u> the temperature of surface water decreases from the equator towards the poles because the amount of insolation decreases poleward.<br/>- <u>Unequal distribution of land and water:</u> the oceans in the northern hemisphere receive more heat due to their contact with a larger extent of land than the oceans in the southern hemisphere.<br/>- <u>Prevailing wind:</u> the winds blowing from the land towards the oceans drive warm surface water away from the coast resulting in the upwelling of cold water from below. It results in the longitudinal variation in the temperature. Contrary to this, the onshore winds pile up warm water near the coast and this raises the temperature.<br/>- <u>Ocean currents:</u> warm ocean currents raise the temperature in cold areas while cold currents decrease the temperature in warm ocean areas. The Gulf Stream (warm current) raises the temperature near the eastern coast of North America and the West Coast of Europe while the Labrador Current (cold current) lowers the temperature near the northeast coast of North America.",https://abhigyanacademy.com/upload/gallery/1720274470.png
Which condition out of the following will increase the evaporation of water?,NA,D,Adding common salt to water,Decrease in temperature of water,Decrease of surface,Increase in the temperature of water,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is an Increase in the temperature of water.<br/><br/>- Increase in the temperature of water will increase the evaporation of water.<br/>- Evaporation is the process where a liquid is converted into its vapour and removed from the evaporating surface.<br/>- Energy is required to change the state of the molecules of water from liquid to vapour.<br/>- An increase in the temperature can provide this energy.<br/>- The driving force to remove water vapour from the evaporating surface is the difference between the water vapour pressure at the evaporating surface and that of the surrounding atmosphere.<br/>- As the surface area of the evaporating surface increases, the rate of evaporation increases.<br/>- Humidity also affects the rate of evaporation.<br/>- As evaporation proceeds, the surrounding air becomes gradually saturated and becomes more humid.<br/>- The process, hence, will slow down and might stop if the wet air is not transferred to the atmosphere (decrease in the humidity of the air).<br/>- The replacement of saturated air with drier air depends greatly on wind speed.<br/>- Hence, surface area, temperature, humidity and wind speed are factors affecting the evaporation process.",NA

In winter, the land cools down much more quickly and to a greater extent than the oceans, leading to a larger temperature contrast. In summer, although the land heats up faster, the difference in temperature between land and sea is generally less extreme than in winter. Hence statement (I) is incorrect<br/><br/>Statement-II Explanation:<br/>The specific heat of water is more than that of the land surface.<br/>Specific heat is a measure of how much heat energy is needed to raise the temperature of a substance.<br/>In this case, water has a higher specific heat than land, meaning it takes more heat energy to raise the temperature of water than it does to raise the temperature of land.<br/>This means that, for the same amount of sunlight energy, water will heat up less than land. Similarly, it takes more loss of heat for water to cool down than it does for land.
