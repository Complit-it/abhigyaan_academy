This statement is incorrect because the Union Executive consists of the President, Vice-President, and the Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister as the head. So option 1 is incorrect.<br/><br/>Statement 2 states that the President may resign his office by writing under his hand-addressed to the Vice-President. This statement is correct. The President has the right to resign by writing a letter to the Vice-President. So option 2 is correct.<br/><br/>Statement 3 states that the executive power of the Union is vested in the Prime Minister. This statement is incorrect. The executive power of the Union is vested in the President and it is exercised by the Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister as the head. So option 3 is incorrect.<br/><br/>Based on the analysis of each statement, we can conclude that only statement 2 is correct. Therefore, the correct answer is option 4 - 2 only.",NA

If the Speaker wants to resign from his office, he must address his resignation in writing to the Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha.<br/>Let&#39;s dissect the other options to understand why they are not correct:<br/>Option 1: President of India. The President of India is the head of state and has no direct authority over the resignation of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha. The Speaker&#39;s resignation is handled within the Parliament.<br/><br/>Option 2: Prime Minister of India. The Prime Minister is the head of government and also does not have authority over the Speaker&#39;s resignation. The Speaker&#39;s resignation is an internal matter of the Parliament.<br/><br/>Option 3: Vice President of India. The Vice President is the presiding officer of the Upper House of Parliament (Rajya Sabha) and does not have jurisdiction over the Speaker&#39;s resignation from the Lok Sabha.<br/><br/>Therefore, the correct option is 4 - Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha, as the Speaker would address the resignation to this position.",NA
Consider the following statements :<br/>1. The Executive Power of the union of India is vested in the Prime Minister.<br/>2. The Prime Minister is the ex officio Chairman of the Civil Services Board.<br/>Which of the statements given above is/are correct?,NA,D,1 only,2 only,Both 1 and 2,Neither 1 nor 2,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is <q>Neither 1 nor 2</q>.<br/>1. The Executive Power of the union of India is not vested solely in the Prime Minister. The Executive Power is vested in the President of India, who exercises it either directly or through officers subordinate to them, as per the provisions of the Constitution of India. The Prime Minister is the head of the government and exercises executive powers, but not the entire Executive Power of the union.<br/>2. The Prime Minister is not the ex officio Chairman of the Civil Services Board. The Civil Services Board is responsible for various administrative matters related to the civil services in India. The Prime Minister is not the automatic Chairman of this board. The Chairman of the Civil Services Board is usually the Cabinet Secretary, who is the highest-ranking civil servant in India.<br/>Therefore, neither statement 1 nor statement 2 is correct.",NA
Which one of the following statements is correct ?,NA,B,The President cannot pardon a person sentenced by a Court Martial.,"The supreme command of the defense forces of the Union is vested in the President, but its exercise has to be regulated by law.",A person awarded rigorous imprisonment cannot be compelled to do hard work as it would violate Article 23 of the Constitution of India.,"The Armed Forces Tribunal Act, 2007 excludes the powers of the High Courts under Article 226 of the Indian Constitution in relation to service matters of persons in the armed forces.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Option 1 states that the President cannot pardon a person sentenced by a Court Martial. This means that if someone is sentenced by a Court Martial, the President does not have the power to pardon them.<br/><br/>Option 2 states that the supreme command of the defense forces of the Union is vested in the President, but its exercise has to be regulated by law. This means that while the President has ultimate authority over the defense forces, the way this authority is exercised needs to be governed by specific laws.<br/><br/>Option 3 states that a person awarded rigorous imprisonment cannot be compelled to do hard work as it would violate Article 23 of the Constitution of India. This statement is incorrect. Article 23 of the Indian Constitution prohibits forced labor, but it does not exempt individuals in prison from performing labor as part of their sentence.<br/><br/>Option 4 states that the Armed Forces Tribunal Act, 2007 excludes the powers of the High Courts under Article 226 of the Indian Constitution in relation to service matters of persons in the armed forces. This means that the Armed Forces Tribunal Act limits the authority of High Courts to hear cases related to service matters of individuals in the armed forces.<br/><br/>The correct answer is option 2, as it accurately reflects the role of the President in relation to having the ultimate authority over the defence forces.",NA
Which one of the following statements relating to the power of the President of India to grant pardon is not correct?,NA,D,The President of India has the power to grant a pardon in cases where the punishment or sentence is given by a Court Martial.,The President of India can grant a pardon in cases where the sentence is death.,The power of judicial review is very limited in relation to the decision of the President on a mercy petition.,The power to grant pardon by the President is the power that the sovereign never exercises against its own judicial mandate.,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Option 1: The statement is correct. The President of India has the power to grant a pardon in cases where the punishment or sentence is given by a Court Martial. This power allows the President to show mercy and override the decision made by the military court.<br/>Option 2: The statement is correct. The President of India can grant a pardon in cases where the sentence is death. This power gives the President the authority to commute or reduce the sentence of death penalty to a lesser punishment or completely pardon the individual.<br/>Option 3: The statement is correct. The power of judicial review, which is the authority of the courts to review and declare the actions of the executive or legislative branches unconstitutional, is limited in relation to the decision of the President on a mercy petition. This means that the courts have limited power to review or overturn the President&#39;s decision to grant or reject a mercy petition.<br/>Option 4: The statement is incorrect. The power to grant pardon by the President is not a power that the sovereign never exercises against its own judicial mandate. In fact, the power of pardon is an essential aspect of the executive power of the President. The President has the authority to grant pardons or reduce sentences, even in cases where the judiciary has made a decision.<br/>Therefore, Option 4 is the incorrect statement.",NA
