Ashoka wanted to control both the land and sea routes to south India, and any hostile power obstructing the route would have had to be conquered.<br/>Explanation:<br/>- The Kalinga war took place in 261 BCE when the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka invaded the kingdom of Kalinga, which lay along the eastern coast of India.<br/>- There were multiple factors that contributed to the war, but the primary reason was Ashoka&#39;s ambition to control both the land and sea routes to south India.<br/>- South India was a major source of wealth and resources for trade, and controlling these routes would enhance the prosperity and power of the Mauryan empire.<br/>- Kalinga was a strategically important region as it lay between the Mauryan Empire and the southern kingdoms, and its control would ensure uninterrupted access to these trade routes.<br/>- The hostile power of Kalinga obstructing the route made it necessary for Ashoka to conquer the region in order to secure the trade routes and further expand the Mauryan empire.<br/>- Although other factors such as Kalinga&#39;s growing power, the piracy by the Nagas, and its potential threat to the Mauryan empire might have played a role, the primary cause of the war was Ashoka&#39;s ambition to control the land and sea routes to south India.",NA
Which of the following was a measure adopted by the later Mauryas to meet the needs of a depleted treasury?,NA,C,Increase in taxes,Imposition of new taxes,Debasement of currency,Increase of imports,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Debasement of Currency as a Measure to Meet the Needs of a Depleted Treasury:<br/>- Definition of debasement: Debasement of currency refers to the act of reducing the value of a currency, particularly in terms of the amount of precious metal it contains. This is usually done by increasing the amount of non-precious metals in the coinage, thus reducing the overall value of the coins.<br/>- Later Mauryas&#39; situation: The later Mauryan period faced economic challenges due to depleted treasury, which was a result of various factors such as warfare expenses, decreased trade, and increased administrative costs.<br/>- Adopting debasement as a solution: To address the issue of a depleted treasury, the later Mauryas opted for the debasement of currency as opposed to increasing taxes or imposing new taxes. This decision was made to avoid causing further discontent among the population, which could have potentially led to unrest and rebellion.<br/>- Effects of debasement: Debasement of currency allowed the Mauryan government to create more coins with the same amount of precious metal, thus increasing the money supply in the economy. This helped the government to meet its immediate financial needs, but it also led to inflation and a decrease in the value of the currency over time.<br/>In conclusion, the later Mauryas chose to debase their currency as a measure to meet the needs of a depleted treasury. While this decision provided short-term relief, it also had long-term consequences for the economy, including inflation and a decline in the value of the currency.",NA
