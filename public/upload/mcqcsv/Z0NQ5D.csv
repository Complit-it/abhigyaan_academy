Nominal GNP is same as,NA,D,Real GNP,GNP less Net factor income from abroad,GNP at constant prices,GNP at current prices,NA,NA,NA,NA,"GNP Deflator: It is clear that nominal GNP usually exceeds real GNP because of inflation. Greater the difference between nominal and real GNP, greater is the inflation. It may happen that GNP data at constant prices may not be available in the economy.",NA
Real GNP is same as,NA,C,Nominal GNP,GNP at current prices,GNP at constant prices,GNP less Net factor income from abroad,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is C: GNP at constant prices. <br/><br/>Real Gross National Product (GNP) is the value of the final goods and services produced within a country&#39;s borders in a given year, adjusted for changes in the prices of goods and services. It is calculated using constant prices, which means that the prices used to value the goods and services are from a base year, rather than the current year. This helps to eliminate the effect of inflation on the GNP calculation.<br/><br/>Nominal GNP, on the other hand, is the value of the final goods and services produced within a country&#39;s borders in a given year, valued at current market prices. It includes the effect of inflation.<br/><br/>GNP at current prices is the same as nominal GNP.<br/><br/>GNP less Net factor income from abroad is a measure of Gross National Income (GNI), which is similar to GNP but includes income earned by domestic residents from foreign sources, such as rent or dividends.",NA
Real flow is the flow of,NA,B,Money,Goods and services,Services only,Goods only,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Real flow is the exchange of goods and services between household and firms whereas money flow is the monetary exchange between two sectors.

State which one of the following is true.,NA,C,Gross domestic capital formation is always greater than gross fixed capital formation.,Nominal GDP can never be less that real GDP,Capital formation is a flow,Bread is always a consumer good.,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is C: Capital formation is a flow. <br/><br/>Capital formation is the process of creating or increasing the stock of capital goods in an economy. It can be either gross or net, depending on whether it includes depreciation of capital goods. Gross capital formation includes the entire value of new capital goods produced, while net capital formation subtracts the value of capital goods that are no longer in use or have been consumed through wear and tear.<br/><br/>Gross domestic capital formation refers to the total value of new capital goods produced within a country&#39;s borders, while gross fixed capital formation specifically refers to the value of new physical capital goods such as machinery, buildings, and infrastructure. Gross domestic capital formation can be greater or lesser than gross fixed capital formation, depending on the mix of capital goods being produced in a given year.<br/><br/>Nominal GDP is the value of all final goods and services produced within a country&#39;s borders in a given year, valued at current market prices. Real GDP is the value of all final goods and services produced within a country&#39;s borders in a given year, adjusted for changes in the prices of goods and services. Nominal GDP can be greater or lesser than real GDP, depending on whether the economy is experiencing inflation or deflation.<br/><br/>Bread is an example of a consumer good, which is a type of final good or service that is consumed by households rather than used in the production of other goods or services.",NA

Microeconomics is different from macroeconomics as,NA,D,Microeconomics deals with prices only,Microeconomics deals with government&#39;s decisions,Microeconomics deals with economic behaviour,Microeconomics deals with individual behaviour,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is D: Microeconomics deals with individual behavior. <br/><br/>Microeconomics is the study of how households and firms make decisions, and how they interact in markets. It focuses on the behavior of individual economic agents, such as consumers, firms, and industries. Microeconomics is concerned with the allocation of resources at the micro level, such as how households and firms decide what to produce, how much to produce, and at what price to sell their products.<br/><br/>Macroeconomics, on the other hand, is the study of the economy as a whole. It focuses on the behavior of aggregate variables, such as GDP, unemployment, and inflation, and how they are affected by economic policies. Macroeconomics is concerned with the overall performance of the economy and the interrelationships among the various sectors of the economy.<br/><br/>Microeconomics does not only deal with prices, and it is not only concerned with government decisions.

Factor payments are the incomes earned by these factors of production. An example of factor payments is an employer&#39;s contribution for social security. <br/><br/>-Retirement pension: Retirement pension is a payment received by individuals after they retire.

An example of non-durable goods is,NA,B,TV,Milk,Microwave,None of These,NA,NA,NA,NA,"An example of non-durable goods is milk.<br/>Non-durable goods are products that have a short lifespan and are typically consumed or used up quickly. They are often perishable and cannot be stored for long periods of time. Milk is a perfect example of a non-durable good because it spoils relatively quickly and cannot be used once it has expired.<br/>Here is a breakdown of why milk is considered a non-durable good:<br/>1. Perishability: Milk is a perishable product that has a limited shelf life.<br/>2. Consumption: Milk is a consumable product that is typically used up quickly.<br/>3. Short lifespan: Compared to durable goods like televisions or microwaves, milk has a significantly shorter lifespan.<br/>In contrast, durable goods like televisions and microwaves are designed to last for a longer period of time and are not meant to be consumed or used up quickly. They can be stored and used repeatedly over an extended period without losing their functionality.<br/>Therefore, milk is an example of a non-durable good due to its perishability, limited shelf life, and the need for proper storage and consumption within a short period of time.",NA
An example of semi durable goods is,NA,C,TV,Fan,Crockery,Milk,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Semi durable goods are products that have a longer lifespan than non-durable goods but a shorter lifespan than durable goods.

Can the change in inventories be in negative?,NA,,Nominal GNP,Yes,Can&#39;t Say,Never,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Yes, the change in inventories can be negative.<br/>Explanation:<br/>- The change in inventories refers to the difference between the ending inventory and the beginning inventory over a specific period.<br/>- If the ending inventory is less than the beginning inventory, it indicates a decrease in inventories, which is considered a negative change.<br/>- There are several reasons why the change in inventories can be negative:<br/>- Sales may exceed production or purchasing, leading to a decrease in inventory levels.<br/>- Obsolete or damaged inventory may be written off, resulting in a decrease in inventory.<br/>- Seasonal or cyclical fluctuations in demand may lead to a decrease in inventory levels.<br/>- Inventory adjustments or corrections may result in a decrease in inventory.<br/>- It is important to note that a negative change in inventories does not necessarily indicate a problem.
