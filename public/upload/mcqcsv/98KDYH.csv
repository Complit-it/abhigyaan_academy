Unicellular organisms reproduce by :,NA,A,fission,fragmentation,vegetative propagation,all of them,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Fission, in biology, is the division of a single entity into two or more parts and the regeneration of those parts to separate entities resembling the original. For unicellular organisms, cell division is the only method used to produce new individuals. In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, the outcome of cell reproduction is a pair of daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell. In unicellular organisms, daughter cells are individuals.",NA
