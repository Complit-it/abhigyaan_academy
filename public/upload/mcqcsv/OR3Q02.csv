The earth takes _____ to complete one revolution,NA,D,365 days and 9 hours,365 days and 8 hours,365 days and 7 hours,365 days and 6 hours,NA,NA,NA,NA,Earth takes 365 days and 6 hours to complete a revolution around the sun .That's why leap year takes place as after four years 6 hrs each year becomes a total of 24 hrs making the 366 days of the leap year.,NA
"In leap year, the month of February has",NA,B,31 days,29 days,30 days,28 days,NA,NA,NA,NA,"In each leap year, the month of February has 29 days instead of 28. Adding one extra day in the calendar every four years compensates for the fact that a period of 365 days is shorter than a tropical year by almost 6 hours.",NA
How much time does the earth take time to complete its rotation?,NA,C,22 Hours,23 Hours,24 Hours,20 Hours,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Earth rotates once in about 24 hours with respect to the Sun, but once every 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds with respect to the stars (see below). Earth's rotation is slowing slightly with time; thus, a day was shorter in the past.",NA
It is the position of the earth when the Northern Hemisphere has the longest day and the shortest night,NA,B,Winter Solstice,Summer Solstice,Day Solstice,Night Solstice,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The summer solstice , also known as midsummer, occurs when a planet's rotational axis, or geographical pole on either its Northern or its Southern Hemisphere is most greatly inclined toward the star that it orbits. On the summer solstice, Earth's maximum axial tilt toward the Sun is 23.44degree. (the Sun's declination from the celestial equator is 23.44degree.) This happens twice each year (once in each hemisphere), when the Sun reaches its highest position in the sky as seen from the North or South Pole.",NA
An equinox happens each year,NA,C,Thrice,Four times,Twice,Once,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Equinoxes happen two times in a year when day and night are of equal length. In the Earth's Northern Hemisphere, for example, the vernal equinox cues the beginning of spring around March 21 and the autumnal equinox indicates the beginning of fall around September 23.",NA
The daily motion of the earth is,NA,B,Equinox,Rotation,Longitude,Revolution,NA,NA,NA,NA,Rotation is the movement of the Earth on its axis. Revolution is the movement of the Earth around the Sun in a fixed path or orbit.,NA
The earth travels around the ____ in elliptical.,NA,D,Moon,Mars,Venus,Sun,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Earth travels in an elliptical, or oval-shaped, orbit around the sun. As a result, the distance between Earth and the sun varies by about 3% throughout the year.",NA
Earth receive light from the,NA,C,Moon,Mars,Sun,Venus,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Some of the solar energy that arrives at the Earthbounces off the atmosphere and clouds and back into space. The surface of the Earth receives about half of the incoming solar radiation. The solar energy takes the form of heat and visible light as well as ultraviolet rays, the type of energy that causes sunburn.",NA

"Select the correct option matching together about Earth shadows: <br/><br/>1. Umbra – darker, central part <br/>2. Penumbra – the outer part <br/>3. Antumbra – partly shaded area beyond the umbra",NA,D,Only 1 and 2,Only 2 and 3,Only 1,"All 1, 2 and 3",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Explanation: Shadow of the earth is divided into three parts: <br/>Umbra is the innermost and darkest part of the shadow and an observer experiences a total eclipse. Penumbra is the region in which only a portion of the light source is blocked by the body. Therefore, an observer experiences a partial eclipse. Antumbra is the lighter area of a shadow that appears beyond the umbra. An observer experiences an annular eclipse.",NA
Oceanic tides are the smallest on the,NA,C,full moon day.,new moon day,8th a day of the waxing moon,None of the above,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is 8th a day of the waxing moon.<br/><br/>Key Points:<br/>This is because, during this period, the Moon and Sun are at a right angle with Earth, partially canceling each other's gravitational pull on the oceans. <br/>This results in less pronounced high and low tides, known as neap tides. <br/>Full moon day: This is the time of the highest tides, called spring tides, due to the combined gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun aligned with Earth. <br/>New moon day: Same as the full moon, neap tides do not occur on the new moon day. <br/>3rd day of the waning moon: This is not a specific timing associated with neap tides. The size of tides fluctuates throughout the lunar cycle, with neap tides occurring roughly around the first and third quarters of the moon. <br/><br/>Hence, we can conclude that Oceanic tides are the smallest on the 8th day of the waxing moon.",NA
Bay of Fundy is located along the coast of _________.,NA,A,Canada,Norway,Chile,None of the above,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The Correct Answer is Canada. <br/><br/>Key Points:<br/>The highest tides in the world occur in the Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia, Canada. <br/>The tidal bulge is 15 - 16 m. Because there are two high tides and two low tides every day (roughly a 24-hour period). <br/>As a rough estimate, the tide rises about 240 cm an hour (1,440 cm divided by 6 hours).<br/>The Bay of Biscay is bounded by the west coast of France and the north coast of Spain. <br/>Hudson Bay is an immense inland sea that penetrates deeply into northeastern Canada. <br/>The water in the Bay of Fundy has a natural resonance or rocking motion called a seiche.<br/>You could compare this to the movement of water in a bathtub. Although the water in a bathtub sloshes from one end to the other and back again in a few seconds, it takes about 13 hours for the water in the bay to rock from the mouth of the bay to the head of the bay and back again. As the ocean tide rises and floods into the bay every 12 hours and 25 minutes, it reinforces the rocking motion. <br/>That's how the largest tides in the Bay of Fundy result from tidal resonance.",NA
Which mineral salt is dissolved in a major amount in ocean water?,NA,C,Calcium chloride,Calcium carbonate,Sodium chloride,None of the above,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is Sodium chloride. <br/><br/>Key Points:<br/>Sodium chloride, also known as table salt, is a mineral salt that is dissolved in major amounts in ocean water.<br/>It is estimated that the ocean contains about 35 grams of salt per liter of water, and about 85% of that salt is sodium chloride.<br/>Calcium chloride and calcium sulfate are also present in ocean water but in much smaller amounts compared to sodium chloride.<br/>Calcium carbonate is a mineral that is found in the shells and skeletons of many marine organisms, but it is not dissolved in ocean water as much as sodium chloride.<br/>The high concentration of sodium chloride in ocean water is one of the reasons why it is not safe to drink without proper treatment.<br/><br/>Additional Information:<br/>Calcium chloride is a salt that is commonly used as a de-icing agent on roads and sidewalks, as well as in food production and medical applications.<br/>Calcium sulphate, also known as gypsum, is a mineral that is used in construction, agriculture, and as a food additive.<br/>Calcium carbonate is used in a variety of industries, including construction, paper production, and as a dietary supplement.<br/>It is important to note that while sodium chloride is the most abundant mineral salt in ocean water, there are also many other dissolved substances that contribute to the overall composition of seawater.",NA
The streams of water flowing constantly on the ocean surface in definite directions are called ______.,NA,C,waves,cyclones,ocean currents,None of the above,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The answer is ocean currents.<br/>Ocean currents are the streams of water flowing constantly on the ocean surface in definite directions.They are driven by various factors such as wind, temperature, salinity, and the rotation of the earth. Ocean currents play a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate by distributing heat from the equator to the poles. <br/><br/>Additional Information<br/>Waves are the disturbances that propagate through the ocean surface due to wind or other factors.<br/>They do not have a definite direction of flow. <br/>Waves can be further classified into different types such as wind waves, swell waves, and tsunami waves based on their origin and characteristics.<br/><br/>Cyclones are the low-pressure systems that form over warm ocean waters and are associated with strong winds and heavy rainfall. <br/>Cyclones are also known as hurricanes or typhoons depending on the region where they occur.<br/>They can cause significant damage to coastal areas and marine ecosystems. <br/><br/>Tides are the periodic rise and fall of sea levels caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun. <br/>Tides can be classified into different types such as spring tides and neap tides based on their relative positions of the moon, sun, and the Earth.",NA
The rhythmic rise and fall of ocean water twice in a day is called ______.,NA,D,Wave,Tsunami,Current,Tide,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is Tide.<br/>KEY POINTS:<br/>The rhythmic rise and fall of the ocean twice a day is called a tide.<br/>The intense gravitational force exerted by the sun and the moon on the surface of the earth induce tides.<br/><br/>Additional Information:<br/>When water covers most of the shore by rising to its maximum level, it is known as high tide.<br/>It is low tide as the waterfalls to its lowest level and recedes from the sea.<br/>The water of Earth closer to the moon is drawn under the influence of the gravitational force of the moon which creates a high tide.<br/>The sun, the moon, and the earth are in the same line during the full moon and new moon days and the tides are highest. These tides are called the spring tides.<br/>But when the moon is in its first and last quarter, the ocean waters are drawn in diagonally opposite directions through the gravitational force of the sun and earth resulting in low tides. These tides are called neap tides.<br/>High tides help in navigation as they raise the level of water closer to the coast. This makes it easier for ships to enter the harbour.<br/>High tides assist with fishing as well as much more fish, move closer to the sea during the high tide. This helps fishermen to have an abundant harvest.<br/>The rise and fall of water due to tides is being used in some places to generate electricity.",NA

Flows northwards along the western coast of South America and is actually the continuation of west wind drift. <br/>Labrador Current: It is a Cold current of the Atlantic Ocean. It Originates in the Baffin Bay drifts south eastwards Baffin and Greenland and merges with the Gulf Stream of New Foundland. <br/>Canaries Current: It is a cold current of the Atlantic Ocean.<br/>It is the continuation of North Atlantic Drift along the western coast of the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa in the southern direction.,NA
What is tidal power?,NA,A,Energy from tides,Energy from water,Energy from moon,Energy from sun,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Explanation: Tidal power converts the energy from tides to usable forms. Though tides are water, it is not the same as the energy harnessed from a flowing river. Tides are caused due to moon.",NA
What is/are the cause(s) of tides?,NA,C,Gravitational pull of moon,Gravitational pull of moon and sun,Gravitational pull of sun and moon and rotation of earth,Gravitational pull of sun,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Explanation: Tides are caused by the gravitational pull of moon, sun and the rotation of earth. It is the cumulative effect of all the three factors. No single factor individually dominates the other.",NA
Tidal barrage is similar to ______,NA,B,wind plant,dam,wind turbine,coal plant,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Explanation: Tidal barrage is similar to a dam. As the name suggests, a barrage (barrier) is constructed across an inlet of an ocean bay to harness the energy.",NA
Which of the following best describes the working of a tidal barrage for an incoming tide?,NA,C, Incoming tides ? generator ? barrage ? basin,Incoming tides ? basin ? generator ? barrage,Incoming tides ? barrage ? basin ? generator,Generator ? barrage ? basin ? incoming tides,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Explanation: The incoming tides flow through the barrage into the basin. Once the basin is filled, the water is emptied by allowing it to pass through an electric generator thereby generating electricity.",NA
