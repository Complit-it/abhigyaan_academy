The compound C7H7N02 has,NA,A,17 atoms in a molecule of the compound,equal molecules of C and H by mass,twice the mass of oxygen atoms compared to nitrogen atoms,twice the mass of nitrogen atoms compared to hydrogen atoms,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The compound C7H7N02 does not satisfy any of the given options.<br/>Option 1 states that there are 17 atoms in a molecule of the compound. However, if we count the atoms in the compound C7H7N02, we find that there are actually only 17 atoms present. Therefore, option 1 is incorrect.<br/>Option 2 states that the compound has equal molecules of C and H by mass. This does not hold true for C7H7N02 as the ratio of carbon to hydrogen atoms is not equal. Hence, option 2 is also incorrect.<br/>Option 3 states that the compound has twice the mass of oxygen atoms compared to nitrogen atoms. However, C7H7N02 does not have twice the mass of oxygen compared to nitrogen. Thus, option 3 is incorrect.<br/>Option 4 states that the compound has twice the mass of nitrogen atoms compared to hydrogen atoms. Again, this is not true for C7H7N02.

Two persons are holding a rope of negligible mass horizontally. A 20 kg mass is attached to the rope at the midpoint; as a result the rope deviates from the horizontal direction. The tension required to completely straighten the rope is (g= 10m/s2),NA,D,200 N,20N ,10 N,infinitely large,NA,NA,NA,NA,"<b>The correct answer for this question is option 4, which states that the tension required to completely straighten the rope is infinitely large.</b><br/><br/>When a 20 kg mass is attached to the rope at the midpoint, it creates a downward force due to gravity. This force causes the rope to deviate from the horizontal direction. In order to completely straighten the rope, the tension in the rope needs to be equal to the weight of the hanging mass.<br/>By using Newton&#39;s second law of motion (F = m * a), we can calculate the weight of the hanging mass by multiplying its mass (20 kg) with the acceleration due to gravity (10 m/s^2). The weight of the hanging mass comes out to be 200 N.<br/>Therefore, in order to completely straighten the rope, the tension in the rope should be equal to 200 N. However, as per the given options, the correct answer is option 4, which states that the tension required is infinitely large.<br/><b>This means that the tension required to completely straighten the rope cannot be achieved in a practical sense, as it would need to be infinitely large.</b>",NA
Which of the following is/are the main absorbing organ/organs of plants?,NA,C,Root only,Leaf only,Root and leaf only,"Root, leaf and bark",NA,NA,NA,NA,"<b>The correct answer is option 3, which states that the main absorbing organs of plants are the root and leaf. <br/>Let&#39;s dissect each option to understand why this is the correct answer.</b><br/><br/>Option 1 states that only the root is the main absorbing organ of plants. While roots do play a crucial role in absorbing water and minerals from the soil, they are not the only organ responsible for absorption. Plants also absorb water and nutrients through other parts, so this option is not completely accurate.<br/>Option 2 states that only the leaf is the main absorbing organ of plants. While leaves do have stomata, which allow for gas exchange and some absorption, they are primarily responsible for photosynthesis and respiration. Absorption of water and minerals is not their main function, so this option is also not completely accurate.<br/>Option 4 states that not only the root and leaf but also the bark is the main absorbing organ of plants. However, the bark is primarily responsible for protecting the plant and transporting nutrients, rather than absorption. Therefore, this option is not correct either.<br/><b>In conclusion, option 3 provides the most accurate answer by stating that the main absorbing organs of plants are the root and leaf.</b>",NA
Which one of the following denotes a <q>true</q> fruit?,NA,D,When only the thalamus of the flower grows and develops into a fruit,When only the receptacle of the flower develops into a fruit,When fruit originates only from the calyx of a flower,When only the ovary of the flower grows into a fruit,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Option 1 states that a true fruit is formed when only the thalamus of the flower grows and develops into a fruit. However, this is incorrect. The thalamus of the flower, also known as the floral axis or the receptacle, can contribute to the structure or shape of the fruit, but it alone cannot be considered a true fruit.<br/>Option 2 suggests that a true fruit is formed when only the receptacle of the flower develops into a fruit. This is also incorrect. The receptacle can play a role in fruit development, but it is not sufficient to form a true fruit on its own.<br/>Option 3 states that a true fruit originates only from the calyx of a flower. This is inaccurate as well. The calyx is the outermost whorl of a flower and comprises sepals. While the calyx may protect or enclose the developing fruit, it does not directly contribute to the formation of a true fruit.<br/><br/><b>Option 4, the correct answer, states that a true fruit is formed when only the ovary of the flower grows into a fruit. This is true. The ovary contains the ovule, which upon fertilization, develops into a seed. The ovary wall then undergoes changes and forms the fruit.</b>",NA
"In which one of the following physiological processes, excess water escapes in the form of droplets from a plant?",NA,B,Transpiration,Guttation,Secretion,Excretion,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Option 1: Transpiration. Transpiration is the process by which water is lost from a plant in the form of water vapor through the stomata on the leaves. It helps in the transportation of water and minerals from the roots to the rest of the plant, and also helps in cooling the plant.<br/>Option 2: Guttation. Guttation is the process by which excess water is released from the tips or edges of leaves in the form of droplets. This usually occurs during the night or early morning when the soil is moist and the root pressure is high. Guttation is different from transpiration as it involves the release of liquid water, whereas transpiration involves the release of water vapor.<br/>Option 3: Secretion. Secretion is the process by which specific substances are produced and released by cells or glands. It is not involved in the elimination of excess water in the form of droplets from a plant.<br/>Option 4: Excretion. Excretion is the process by which waste products are eliminated from the body of an organism. It is not related to the elimination of excess water from a plant.<br/><br/><b>Therefore, the correct answer is option 2: Guttation, as it is the physiological process where excess water escapes in the form of dro</b>",NA
"If the xylem of a plant is mechanically blocked, which of the following functions of the plant will be affected?",NA,B,Transport of water only,Transport of water and solutes,Transport of 3olutes only,Transport of gases,NA,NA,NA,NA,"<b>If the xylem of a plant is mechanically blocked, the correct answer is option 2: Transport of water and solutes.</b><br/><br/>The xylem is responsible for the transport of water and minerals from the roots to the rest of the plant. It is a specialized tissue made up of long, tube-like cells that form a network throughout the plant. The primary function of the xylem is to provide structural support and transport water and dissolved minerals from the roots to the leaves and other parts of the plant. This process is known as transpiration.<br/>However, the xylem is also involved in the movement of some solutes, such as nutrients and hormones, though it is not the main transport pathway for solutes. If the xylem is mechanically blocked, the transport of water and solutes will be affected. This can lead to a lack of water and nutrients reaching the different parts of the plant, causing wilting, stunted growth, and ultimately, the death of the plant.<br/>Transport of gases, on the other hand, is primarily done through the stomata - small openings on the surface of the leaves. Gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occur between the plant and the atmosphere through these openings, not through the xylem. Therefore",NA
Which one of the following agents does not contribute to propagation of plants through seed dispersal?,NA,B,Wind,Fungus,Animal,Water,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Option 1: Wind - This option refers to the dispersal of seeds by the wind. Wind is a common agent of seed dispersal for many plant species. Seeds that are lightweight and have structures that aid in air travel, such as wings or hairs, can be carried away by the wind to new locations where they can germinate and grow.<br/>Option 2: Fungus - This option states that fungus is not a contributor to seed dispersal. Fungi typically do not have an active role in dispersing seeds. Instead, they primarily decompose organic matter and assist in the recycling of nutrients in ecosystems.<br/>Option 3: Animal - This option suggests that animals play a role in seed dispersal. Many animals, such as birds, mammals, and reptiles, can consume fruits along with their seeds. These seeds are later dispersed through the animal`s digestive system, often in a location far from the parent plant, providing an opportunity for germination and plant propagation.<br/>Option 4: Water - This option refers to seed dispersal through water. Seeds that are buoyant or have structures that enable them to float can be carried by water currents to new areas where they can establish and grow.<br/><br/><b>Based on the options provided, option 2, <q>Fungus</q>.</b>",NA
