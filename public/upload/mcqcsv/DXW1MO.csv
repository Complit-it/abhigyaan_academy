"The average of a batsman after 25 innings was 56 runs per innings. If after the 26th inning his average increased by 2 runs, then what was his score in the 26th inning?",NA,108,109,108,110,107,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Normal process: <br/>Runs in 26th inning = Runs total after 26 innings – Runs total after 25 innings <br/>= 26 X 58 – 25 X 56 <br/><br/>For Easy calculation use: <br/>= (56 + 2) X 26 – 56 X 25 ) <br/>= 2 X 26 + (56 X 26 – 56 X 25) <br/>= 52 + 56 = 108 <br/><br/>Since the average increases by 2 runs per innings, it is equivalent to 2 runs being added to each score in the first 25 innings. Now, since these runs can only be added by the runs scored in the 26th inning, the score in the 26th inning must be 25 X 2 = 50 runs higher than the average after 26 innings (i.e. new average = 58). <br/><br/>Hence, runs scored in 26th inning: <br/>= New Average + Old innings X Change in average <br/>= 58 + 25 X 2 <br/>= 108",NA
