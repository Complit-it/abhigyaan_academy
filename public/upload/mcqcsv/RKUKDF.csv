An element common to all acids is,NA,D,Chlorine,Nitrogen,Oxygen,Hydrogen,NA,NA,NA,NA,"All acids contain hydrogen, but not all hydrogen-containing compounds are acids. Most acids also contain oxygen.",NA
Identify the type of reaction: HCl + NaOH --> NaCl + H2O,NA,D,Combination reaction,Double decomposition reaction,Decomposition reaction,Neutralisation reaction,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reaction of a strong acid with strong base is called neutralization reaction which produces salt and water, HCl + NaOH --> NaCl + H2O. This equation is already balanced.",NA
Which of the following does not conduct electricity?,NA,D,Sodium hydroxide,Rain water,Hydrochloric acid,Distilled water,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Distilled water do not conduct electricity. The reason is that a liquid conducts electricity is by the positively or negatively charged ions that are actually moving from one of the electrodes to the other, carrying charge (electricity) with them.",NA
Carbon dioxide is an example of:,NA,B,Amphoteric oxide,Acidic oxide,Basic oxide,Neutral oxide,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Acid oxides is a complex chemical substance oxides, which form a salt with the chemical reactions with bases or basic oxides and do not react with acidic oxides. <br/>Examples of acidic oxides can be: CO2 (all known carbon dioxide), P2O5 - oxide of phosphorus (formed in air if burns white phosphorus), SO3 - oxide of sulfur (VI) is a substance used for sulfuric acid.",NA
Which gas is released when acids react with metal carbonates?,NA,B,O2,CO2,CO,H2,NA,NA,NA,NA,"As metal carbonates react with acid, a neutralisation reaction happens. Salt, water, and carbon dioxide are produced. This can be expressed in the following general equation: <br/>metal carbonate + acid --> salt + water + carbon dioxide.",NA
Aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide turns blue litmus:,NA,B,Red,No change,Colourless,Pink,NA,NA,NA,NA,Since Sodium hydroxide is a base and thus it has no effect on a blue litmus paper but it changes red litmus to blue.,NA
Which of the following base is used in the manufacture of bleaching powder?,NA,D,Magnesium hydroxide,Sodium hydroxide,Potassium hydroxide,Calcium hydroxide,NA,NA,NA,NA,Bleaching powder is produced by the action of chlorine on slaked lime. <br/>Ca(OH)2 (Slacked lime) + Cl2 --> CaOCl2 (Bleaching Powder) + H2O,NA
The colour of phenolphthalein in acids is:,NA,A,Colourless,Red,Pink,Blue,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Phenolphthalein is often used as an indicator in acid - base titrations. For this application, it turns colourless in acidic solutions and magenta in basic solutions.",NA
"Turmeric, a natural indicator in presence of bases turns:",NA,A,Bright Red,Blue,No change,Orange,NA,NA,NA,NA,Turmeric solution or paper turns reddish brown with base. Turmeric does not change color with acid.,NA
Which of the following compound can turn blue litmus solution red??,NA,D,CH3CHO,NaOH,CH3OCH3,CH3COOH,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Acid convert blue litmus solution to Red. HCHO, CH3CHO are aldehydes. HCOOH, CH3COOH are carboxylic acids. CH3OH and C2H5OH are alcohols. Out of these only carboxyhc acids would turn blue litmus solution red. So HCOOH and CH3COOH would turn blue litmus solution red.",NA
Marble chips reacts with a solution to produce a gas which turns lime water milky. So the solution contains:?,NA,B,Na2SO4,H2SO4,K2SO4,none of these,NA,NA,NA,NA,Calcium carbonate reacts with sulphuric acid to form calcium sulphate and carbon dioxide which turns lime water milky. <br/><br/>CaCO3 + H2SO4 --> CaSO4 + CO2 + H2O,NA
Identify X in the reaction: 2HCl + CuO --> X + H2O,NA,C,CuCl,Cu(OH)2,CuCl2,HOCl,NA,NA,NA,NA,When copper oxide and dilute hydrochloric acid are mixed the blue green solution is formed. <br/>The reaction is:- CuO + 2HCl --> CuCl2 + H2O,NA
Acids turn blue litmus:,NA,B,Blue,Red,Colourless,Pink,NA,NA,NA,NA,Blue litmus paper turns red under acidic conditions and red litmus paper turns blue under basic or alkaline conditions.,NA
Which of the following is an olfactory indicator?,NA,C,Litmus,Phenolphthalein,Onion,Methyl orange,NA,NA,NA,NA,An olfactory indicator is a material whose smell varies reliant on whether it is mixed with an acidic or basic solution. Olfactory indicators mainly used in laboratory to test whether a solution is a base or an acid. Onion is an example of olfactory indicators.,NA
Acids change the colour of methyl orange to:,NA,B,Colourless,Pink/Red,Blue,Purple,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Methyl orange is a pH indicator frequently used in titration because of its clear and distinct colour variance at different pH values. Methyl orange shows pink colour in acidic medium and yellow colour in basic medium. Because it changes colour at the pH of a mid strength acid, it is usually used in titration for acids. Unlike a universal indicator, methyl orange does not have a full spectrum of colour change, but it has a sharp end point.",NA
Which type of salt is formed when all the replaceable hydrogen atoms in an acid are replaced by a metal ion?,NA,A,Normal Salt,Acid Salt,Hydronium Salt,Alkali Salt,NA,NA,NA,NA,"When all the replaceable hydrogen atoms in an acid are replaced by a metal ion, the salt formed is called a normal salt.",NA
Which of the following substances is a base?,NA,C,Hydrochloric acid,Vinegar (acetic acid),Sodium hydroxide (NaOH),Lemon juice,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is a strong base, while hydrochloric acid and vinegar are acids. Lemon juice contains citric acid, making it acidic.",NA
Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of acids?,NA,B,Turn blue litmus red,Have a bitter taste,Can react with metals to form salts,Release hydrogen ions (H+) in water,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Acids typically have a sour taste, not a bitter taste. They release hydrogen ions (H+) in water and can react with metals to form salts.",NA
