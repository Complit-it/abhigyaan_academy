"Consider the following statements related to the Maratha Confederacy and choose the true statement/s from the below options.<br/><br/>1. The Maratha Confederacy was officially founded in 1674 with the coronation of Shivaji Maharaj, embodying the collective resistance against Mughal expansion in India.<br/><br/>2. The Maratha Confederacy extensively used guerrilla warfare tactics, mastered and popularized by Shivaji Maharaj, as a principal military strategy against their adversaries throughout its existence.<br/><br/>3. The Treaty of Purandar (1665) between Shivaji Maharaj and the Mughal Empire formalized the structure of the Maratha Confederacy by recognizing Maratha autonomy in certain regions.<br/><br/>4. The concept of Chauth and Sardeshmukhi were revenue systems introduced by the Maratha Confederacy, where Chauth represented a 25% tax on land revenues collected by local rulers, and Sardeshmukhi was an additional 10% levy on top of Chauth claimed by the Marathas as the rightful sovereigns.",NA,C,1 and 2 only are correct.,"1, 2, and 3 are correct.",Only 4 is correct.,"1, 2, 3, and 4 are correct.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"<u>Key Points:</u><br/>- While Shivaji Maharaj&#39;s coronation in 1674 was a significant milestone in the assertion of Maratha independence and identity, it did not mark the official founding of the Maratha Confederacy.<br/>- The Confederacy, as a loose collective of Maratha states, emerged much later towards the 18th century, particularly after the death of Aurangzeb in 1707 and during the subsequent decline of Mughal power.<br/>- Although guerrilla warfare was indeed a significant and innovative strategy employed by Shivaji Maharaj, the Maratha Confederacy did not exclusively rely on this tactic throughout its existence.<br/>- The Treaty of Purandar (1665) was indeed a pivotal moment, but it did not formalize the structure of the Maratha Confederacy. The treaty was between Shivaji Maharaj and the Mughal Empire, where Shivaji agreed to cede some forts and territories as well as serve as a Mughal vassal.<br/>- Chauth and Sardeshmukhi were indeed two critical revenue systems introduced by the Marathas.<br/>- Chauth was a tax equivalent to 25% of the land revenue claimed from the territories under Maratha influence but not directly administered by them, serving as a form of protection money. Sardeshmukhi was an additional levy of 10%, justified by the Marathas on the basis of their claim to be the hereditary Sardeshmukhs (chief headmen) of the territory.
