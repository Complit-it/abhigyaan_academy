Which one of the following gases is released mostly from landfills in urban areas?,NA,C,Nitrogen,Hydrogen,Methane,Oxygen,NA,NA,NA,NA,"<b>The correct answer is option 3 - Methane.<br/> Methane is the gas that is primarily released from landfills in urban areas.</b><br/><br/>To understand why methane is released from landfills, we need to consider the process of decomposition. When organic waste, such as food scraps and yard waste, is thrown into a landfill, it undergoes anaerobic decomposition. Anaerobic decomposition occurs in the absence of oxygen, and it produces methane gas as a byproduct.<br/>Methane is a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming and climate change. It has a much higher global warming potential compared to carbon dioxide, making it a significant concern for environmental impact.<br/>The other options - Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen - are not released primarily from landfills. Nitrogen is a component of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere and is not specifically associated with landfills. Hydrogen is a highly flammable gas and is not commonly released from landfills. Oxygen is also not released in significant amounts from landfills, as the decomposition process occurs in an oxygen-deprived environment.",NA
Which one of the following is most sensitive to environmental change?,NA,C,Amphibian,Reptile,Mammal,Insect,NA,NA,NA,NA,"<b>The correct answer is option 3: Mammal.<br/> This is because mammals have a higher sensitivity to environmental changes compared to other options listed.</b><br/><br/>Amphibians (option 1) are also sensitive to environmental changes, but they have the ability to adapt to a certain extent.
