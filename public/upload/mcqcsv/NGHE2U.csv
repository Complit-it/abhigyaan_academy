What is the latent heat of fusion?,NA,B,The amount of heat needed to change the temperature of a substance.,The heat required to convert a substance from a solid to a liquid state without changing its temperature.,The heat required to vaporize a substance.,The heat required to change the Temperature of a substance from 0°C to 100°C.,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Correct Answer is Option B. <br/> Option B specifically describes the concept of latent heat of fusion. When a substance changes from a solid to a liquid state (such as ice melting into water), it requires a certain amount of heat energy without a change in temperature. This energy is used to break the intermolecular forces holding the solid together and allow the particles to move freely in the liquid phase.",NA
What is the difference between heat and temperature?,NA,B,"Heat is a measure of temperature, while temperature is the quantity of heat energy.","Heat is the degree of hotness or coldness, while temperature is the sensation of warmth.","Heat indicates the intensity of thermal conditions, while temperature denotes the quantity of heat energy.",Heat and temperature are the same thing.,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Heat refers to the transfer of energy between objects due to a temperature difference. It is the energy in transit from hotter object to  a cooler one. <br/><br/>Temperature, on the other hand, is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles (atoms or molecules) in a substance. It indicates how hot or cold an object is. <br/><br/>In summary: Heat is related ot he transfer of energy, and Temperature is related to the degree of hotness or coldness. <br/>So, option B is correct.",NA
What is the purpose of a bimetal strip in a thermostat?,NA,B,To conduct electricity,To measure temperature accurately,To bend when heated or cooled,To heat up quickly,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Correct option is B. The purpose of a bimetal strip in thermostats is to measure temperature accurately when heated or cooled. It consists of two different metals (usually steel and copper) bonded together. When heated or cooled, these metals expand or contract at different rates due to their varying coefficients of thermal expansion. This differential expansion causes the bimetal strip to bend, which is used to actuate the thermostat and control temperature.Let’s break down other options: <br/><br/>a) To conduct electricity: This is not the primary purpose of a bimetal strip in thermostats. Bimetal strips are not primarily used for conducting electricity. <br/>c) To bend when heated or cooled: While this statement is true, it doesn’t fully capture the purpose of the bimetal strip. The bending of the strip is a consequence of its accurate temperature measurement function. <br/>d) To heat up quickly: This is not the purpose of a bimetal strip. Its primary role is to respond to temperature changes, not to heat up quickly.",NA
Which temperature scale assigns 0°C to the melting point of pure ice and 100°C to the boiling point of pure water?,NA,C,Fahrenheit,Rankine,Celsius,Kelvin,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is c) Celsius. <br/>Here’s why: <br/><br/>Celsius (°C): This scale is commonly used in scientific and everyday contexts. It is based on the freezing and boiling points of water. Specifically:<br/>-0°C corresponds to the melting point (freezing point) of pure water under standard atmospheric pressure. <br/>-100°C corresponds to the boiling point of pure water under the same conditions. <br/>The other options are as follows: <br/>a) Fahrenheit: The Fahrenheit scale is another temperature scale, but it does not assign 0°F to the freezing point and 100°F to the boiling point of water. Instead, it has different reference points. <br/>b) Rankine: The Rankine scale is an absolute temperature scale (similar to Kelvin), but it is not commonly used in everyday applications. <br/>d) Kelvin: The Kelvin scale is an absolute temperature scale used in scientific contexts. It assigns 0 K to absolute zero (the lowest possible temperature), but it does not directly correspond to the freezing and boiling points of water. <br/>Therefore, the correct answer is c) Celsius.",NA

Rate of evaporation is inversely proportional to,NA,,Surface area,Temperature,Humidity ,None of the above,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Explanation: <br/>Surface area: If the surface area increases, the rate of evaporation increases, and decreases with a decrease in the surface area. This means the surface area is directly proportional to the rate of evaporation. <br/>Temperature: With the increase in temperature, more number of particles get enough kinetic energy to go into the vapor state. With the increase in temperature, the rate of evaporation increases, and decreases with a decrease in the temperature. This means the temperature is directly proportional to the rate of evaporation. <br/>Humidity: Humidity is the amount of water vapor present in the air. If the amount of water in the air is already high, the rate of evaporation decreases. This means the humidity is inversely proportional to the rate of evaporation. <br/>Wind speed: If the wind speed increases, the rate of evaporation increases, and decreases with a decrease in the wind speed. This means the wind speed is directly proportional to the rate of evaporation.",NA
A device that converts heat energy into work in a cyclic process is,NA,,Refrigerator,Turbine,Heat engine,None of the above,NA,NA,NA,NA,"CONCEPT: <br/>Heat engine: A heat engine is a closed-cycle device that takes heat from a hot reservoir, does useful work and rejects the remaining heat to a cold reservoir. <br/>In each cycle, the heat engine absorbs a heat Q1 from the hot reservoir, converts it into useful work W and the remaining heat Q2 is rejected to the cold reservoir. <br/>All state variables - pressure, temperature, and volume return to their initial values at the end of every cycle.
Hence, the change in internal energy is zero for each cycle. <br/>Therefore, from the first law of thermodynamics, the net heat absorbed is equal to the work done. <br/>Work done = Q2 - Q1 <br/><br/>EXPLANATION: A device that converts heat energy into work in a cyclic process is a heat engine.",NA
