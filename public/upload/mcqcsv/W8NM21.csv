When does the moment of inertia of a body come into the picture?,NA,A,When the motion is rotational,When the motion is linear,When the motion is along a curved path,None of the above,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The answer is A, The moment of inertia of a body come into picture when the motion is rotational. <br/>Moment of inertia, denoted by I, measures the extent to which an object resists rotational acceleration about a particular axis, it is the rotational analogue to mass (which determines an object&#39;s resistance to linear acceleration). The moments of inertia of a mass have units of dimension ML<sup>2</sup> ([mass] × [length]<sup>2</sup>).",NA
