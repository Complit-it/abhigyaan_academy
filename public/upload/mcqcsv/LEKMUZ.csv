What is the difference between heat and temperature?,NA,B,"Heat is a measure of temperature, while temperature is the quantity of heat energy.","Heat is the degree of hotness or coldness, while temperature is the sensation of warmth.","Heat indicates the intensity of thermal conditions, while temperature denotes the quantity of heat energy.",Heat and temperature are the same thing.,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Heat refers to the transfer of energy between objects due to a temperature difference. It is the energy in transit from hotter object to  a cooler one.<br/><br/>Temperature, on the other hand, is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles (atoms or molecules) in a substance. It indicates how hot or cold an object is.<br/><br/>In summary, Heat is related ot he transfer of energy, and Temperature is related to the degree of hotness or coldness.<br/>So, option B is correct.",NA
What is the latent heat of fusion?,NA,B,The amount of heat needed to change the temperature of a substance.,The heat required to convert a substance from a solid to a liquid state without changing its temperature.,The heat required to vaporize a substance.,The heat required to change the Temperature of a substance from 0°C to 100°C.,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Correct Answer is Option B.<br/>Option B specifically describes the concept of latent heat of fusion. When a substance changes from a solid to a liquid state (such as ice melting into water), it requires a certain amount of heat energy without a change in temperature. This energy is used to break the inter-molecular forces holding the solid together and allow the particles to move freely in the liquid phase.",NA
