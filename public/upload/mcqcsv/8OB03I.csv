Which of the following is Demand-Pull Inflation:,NA,D,"According to Keynesian it is that the demand increases over the same level of supply, or the supply decreases with the same level of demand.","According to monetarists, it is the creation of extra purchasing power to the consumer over the same level of production.",Neither of them,Both of them,NA,NA,NA,NA,"A mismatch between demand and supply pulls up prices.<br/>Either the demand increases over the same level of supply, or the supply decreases with the same level of demand and thus the situation of demand-pull inflation arises.<br/><br/>This was a Keynesian idea. The Keynesian School suggests cuts in spending as the way of tackling excess demand mainly by increasing taxes and reducing government expenditure.<br/>Monetarists view Demand-pull inflation as the creation of extra purchasing power to the consumer over the same level of production.<br/>This is the type of creating extra money (either by the printing or public borrowing) without equivalent creation in production/supply i.e. too much money chasing too little output.",NA

Consider the following statements.<br/>1. The governments may take recourse to tighter monetary policy to cool down either the demand-pull or the cost-push inflations.<br/>2.

Tighter monetary policy is used by governments to reduce inflation, whether it is demand-pull or cost-push inflation. It involves increasing interest rates or reducing the money supply in the economy, making borrowing more expensive and discouraging excessive spending. This helps to reduce aggregate demand, thus cooling down inflationary pressures.<br/>2. The statement is incorrect because tighter monetary policy is not intended to increase the money supply in the economy; rather, it is aimed at reducing the money supply. An increase in the money supply is associated with looser monetary policy, which is used to stimulate economic growth during periods of slow economic activity or recession.",NA

Consider the following statements.<br/>1. Rising inflation indicates rising aggregate demand and indicates comparatively lower supply and higher purchasing capacity among the consumers<br/>2. Higher inflation suggests the producers to increase their production level as it is generally considered as an Inflation of higher demand in the economy<br/>Which of these statements is/are incorrect?,NA,D,1 Only,2 Only,None of them,Both 1 and 2 ,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The first statement says that rising inflation indicates rising aggregate demand, which suggests a comparatively lower supply and higher purchasing capacity among consumers. This is False. Rising inflation could indicate rising demand, but it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean there is a higher purchasing capacity among consumers. Inflation can erode purchasing power if wages do not increase at the same rate as prices. Additionally, inflation can also be caused by factors other than aggregate demand, such as increased costs of production or supply chain disruptions.<br/>The second statement suggests that higher inflation prompts producers to increase their production level as it is generally considered a sign of higher demand. This is false; producers might increase production if they perceive inflation as a sign of increased demand. However, if inflation is caused by supply-side factors (like increased costs of raw materials), higher production levels may not be feasible or profitable. Furthermore, inflation could also be a result of too much money chasing too few goods, which doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that demand has increased in real terms - it could just mean that the money supply has increased.",NA

"Consider the following statements.<br/>1. Real interest rate is always lower than the normal interest rate.<br/>2. To neutralize the effects of inflation premium, the lender takes the recourse to decrease the nominal rate of interest.<br/>Which of these statements is/are correct?",NA,A,None of them,2 Only,Both 1 and 2,1 Only,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Neither statement is entirely correct.<br/>The real interest rate can be higher or lower than the nominal interest rate, depending on the inflation rate. The real interest rate is the nominal interest rate adjusted for inflation, so if the inflation rate is higher than the nominal interest rate, then the real interest rate is negative. However, if the inflation rate is lower than the nominal interest rate, then the real interest rate is positive and can be higher than the nominal interest rate.<br/>To neutralize the effects of inflation premium, the lender may increase the nominal rate of interest, not decrease it. The inflation premium is the amount of compensation that lenders require to protect themselves against the erosion of purchasing power caused by inflation. Lenders will typically increase the nominal interest rate to account for the inflation premium, not decrease it.<br/>Therefore, neither statement is entirely correct.",NA

What is the effect of inflation on the expenditure?<br/>1. Increased prices make our consumption levels fall as goods and services we buy get costlier.<br/>2.

This means that the purchasing power of their income decreases, which ultimately leads to a decrease in consumption levels. <br/>Inflation also increases the cost of borrowing money, which means that the interest rates on loans increase. As a result, people and businesses tend to decrease their investment expenditure as the cost of borrowing money becomes too high.<br/>Therefore, both statements correctly describe the effects of inflation on expenditure.",NA
"What is the effect of inflation on the tax structure of the economy?<br/>1. Taxpayers suffer while paying there direct and indirect taxes<br/>2.
