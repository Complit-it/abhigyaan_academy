While this is related to humidity, it does not fully define it. Humidity refers to the amount of moisture present in the air, not just the physical form of water droplets.<br/><br/>Option 2: This option refers to the deposition of atmospheric moisture. Deposition does occur when there is high humidity, but it does not encompass the entire concept of humidity. Humidity involves measuring the moisture content in the air, not just the process of deposition.<br/><br/>Option 3: This option describes almost microscopically small drops of water that are condensed from and suspended in the air. This is a more accurate description of what humidity entails. Humidity refers to the presence of water vapor in the air, which can condense and form these small water droplets.<br/><br/>Option 4: This option correctly defines humidity as the moisture content of the atmosphere at a particular time and place. It encompasses the overall amount of water vapor in the air, which can fluctuate depending on factors such as temperature and pressure. This is the best definition of humidity among the given options.<br/><br/>Therefore, the correct answer is 4.",NA
Which one of the following instruments is used for measuring moisture content of air?,NA,B,Hydrometer ,Hygrometer,Hypsometer,Pycnometer,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The instrument used for measuring the moisture content of air is called a hygrometer.<br/><br/>Option 1: A hydrometer is used for measuring the specific gravity of liquids and is not designed for measuring moisture content in the air.<br/>Option 3: A hypsometer is used for measuring the height of a location above sea level and is not relevant to measuring moisture content in the air.<br/>Option 4: A pycnometer is used for measuring the density of a liquid and is not suitable for measuring moisture content in the air.<br/><br/><b>A Hygrometer</b>, on the other hand, is specifically designed to measure the moisture or humidity in the air. It can provide information about the amount of water vapor present in the air, which can be useful in various applications such as weather forecasting, indoor environment monitoring, or agricultural purposes. The hygrometer works by measuring the moisture in the air through different methods, such as electrical resistance, capacitance, or the use of a hair or synthetic material that responds to changes in humidity.",NA
Which one of the following instruments is used for measuring the humidity of the air?,NA,C,Wind vane,Aneroid barometer,Wet and dry bulb thermometer.,Maximum and minimum thermometer,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option 3: wet and dry bulb thermometer.<br/>Humidity refers to the amount of water vapor present in the air. It is a measure of how much moisture is in the air.<br/><br/>Option 1, wind vane, is used to measure wind direction, not humidity. It shows which direction the wind is coming from.<br/><br/>Option 2, aneroid barometer, measures atmospheric pressure and is used to forecast weather changes. It does not directly measure humidity.<br/><br/>Option 3, wet and dry bulb thermometer, is specifically designed to measure humidity. It consists of two thermometers placed side by side, one with a wet cloth wrapped around its bulb and the other with a dry bulb. As the water evaporates from the wet bulb, it cools the bulb and causes a temperature difference between the two thermometers. This temperature difference is used to calculate the relative humidity.<br/><br/>Option 4, maximum and minimum thermometer, is used to measure the maximum and minimum temperature during a specific time period, not humidity.",NA
Consider the following statements:<br/>1. The difference between the moisture-holding capacity of air and its actual humidity is called saturation deficit. <br/>2. The temperature to which air has to be cooled in order to reach saturation is called dew point. <br/>Which of the statements given above is/are correct?,NA,C,1 only,2 only,Both 1 and 2,Neither 1 nor 2,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option-3: Both 1 and 2.<br/><br/>Statement 1 is correct. Saturation deficit refers to the difference between the moisture-holding capacity of air and its actual humidity. In other words, it is the amount of moisture that the air can still hold before reaching saturation. This can be calculated by subtracting the actual humidity from 100.<br/><br/>Statement 2 is also correct. The dew point is the temperature at which air needs to be cooled in order to reach saturation, meaning that the air cannot hold any more moisture and condensation begins to occur. The dew point is an important factor in determining weather conditions and can influence the formation of fog, dew, and frost.<br/>Therefore, both statements 1 and 2 are accurate explanations of the concepts of saturation deficit and dew point.",NA
What is the term used to denote the critical temperature at which the air becomes saturated with vapour and below which the condensation is likely to begin?,NA,C,Condensation point,Evaporation point,Dew point,Point of critical temperature,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option 3: Dew point. The dew point is the term used to denote the critical temperature at which the air becomes saturated with vapor and below which condensation is likely to begin. When the temperature of the air drops below the dew point, it cannot hold all of the water vapor it contains, resulting in the water vapor condensing into liquid droplets.<br/><br/>Option 1, condensation point, is incorrect because while it refers to the point at which condensation begins, it is not specifically related to the saturation of air with vapor.<br/><br/>Option 2, evaporation point, is incorrect because it refers to the temperature at which a liquid vaporizes, rather than the point at which condensation occurs in the air.<br/><br/>Option 4, point of critical temperature, is incorrect because it is a term unrelated to the saturation of air with vapor.<br/><br/>Therefore, the correct term to denote the critical temperature at which the air becomes saturated with vapor and below which condensation is likely to begin is the dew point.",NA

The process involved is an example of,NA,C,Condensation,Precipitation,Deposition,Evaporation,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The process involved in the formation of a crust on rocks due to the vapours of sulphur escaping from a volcano is an example of deposition. Deposition is a phase change process where a substance changes from a gaseous state to a solid state directly, without going through the liquid state.<br/><br/>Option 1: Condensation is the process of a gas changing into a liquid state. It occurs when the gas loses thermal energy and the particles come together to form liquid droplets. This does not apply to the given scenario as the sulphur vapors are directly solidifying on the rocks.<br/><br/>Option 2: Precipitation refers to the process of water droplets falling from the atmosphere to the ground as rain, snow, sleet, or hail. This option is not applicable to the given scenario as it specifically deals with water, not sulphur vapors.<br/><br/>Option 4: Evaporation is the process by which a liquid changes into a gas state. It does not correspond to the given scenario as the vapors are not turning into a gas form.<br/><br/>In conclusion, option 3 - deposition is the correct answer as it accurately describes the process of the vapors of sulphur directly solidifying and forming a crust on the rocks from the volcano.",NA
"Snow, sleet and hail are the forms of",NA,A,Precipitation,Condensation,Transpiration,Evaporation,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option 1: Precipitation.<br/>Precipitation refers to any form of water that falls from the atmosphere to the Earth&#39;s surface. Snow, sleet, and hail are all examples of precipitation.<br/>Snow occurs when water vapor in the atmosphere condenses directly into ice crystals, which then fall to the ground. Sleet is a mixture of raindrops that freeze into ice pellets before reaching the ground. Hail forms when strong updrafts in thunderstorms carry raindrops upward into extremely cold areas of the atmosphere, causing them to freeze and form layers of ice.<br/><br/>Option 2, condensation, refers to the process by which water vapor changes from a gas to a liquid as it cools and loses energy. While snow, sleet, and hail do involve condensation, they are specifically forms of precipitation.<br/><br/>Option 3, transpiration, is the process by which plants release water vapor into the atmosphere through their leaves. This is not the correct option as it is not related to snow, sleet, and hail.<br/><br/>Option 4, evaporation, is the process by which water changes from a liquid to a gas as it heats up and gains energy. While evaporation is involved in the water cycle that leads to precipitation, it is not related to the formation of snow, sleet or hail.",NA
Which one of the following is likely to be the most prevalent form of weathering in hot-tropical desert areas?,NA,A,Mechanical,Chemical,Biological,Leaching,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The most prevalent form of weathering in hot-tropical desert areas is likely to be mechanical weathering. Mechanical weathering, also known as physical weathering, is the process of breaking down rocks into smaller pieces without any change in the chemical composition of the rocks. This type of weathering is common in desert areas due to the extreme temperature fluctuations and high levels of solar radiation.<br/><br/>Option 1: Mechanical weathering is the correct answer. It includes processes such as thermal stress, frost wedging, and abrasion, which are all common in hot-tropical desert environments.<br/><br/>Option 2: Chemical weathering involves the decomposition and alteration of rocks through chemical reactions. While chemical weathering does occur in desert areas, it is typically less prevalent compared to mechanical weathering.<br/><br/>Option 3: Biological weathering refers to the breakdown of rocks by living organisms, such as plants and animals. While plants and animals do exist in desert areas, the harsh conditions make biological weathering less prevalent compared to other forms of weathering.<br/><br/>Option 4: Leaching is a process where minerals are dissolved and carried away by water.

There is high diurnal range in temperature.<br/>Select the correct answer using the code given below.,NA,A,1 only,2 only,Both 1 and 2,Neither 1 nor 2,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option 1, which states that hydrolysis is an effective form of chemical decomposition of bedrock in humid tropics because humid tropics experience high temperature and humidity.<br/><br/>Hydrolysis is a chemical process where water molecules break down minerals in rocks, causing them to decompose and break apart. In humid tropics, the combination of high temperature and humidity provides the ideal conditions for hydrolysis to occur.<br/<br/>High temperature increases the rate of chemical reactions, including hydrolysis. The warm climate in humid tropics accelerates the process, making it more efficient in decomposing bedrock.<br/><br/>Humidity, on the other hand, is the amount of moisture in the air. In humid tropics, there is typically a high level of humidity due to the warm and moist climate. The presence of moisture is crucial for hydrolysis to take place as water is one of the main agents involved in the chemical breakdown of minerals in rocks.<br/><br/>Therefore, the combination of high temperature and humidity in humid tropics makes hydrolysis an effective form of chemical decomposition of bedrock.",NA
The humidity of air depends on,NA,D,Temperature,Location,Weather,All the above,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option 4 - All of the above.<br/><br/>Humidity of air is influenced by various factors including temperature, location, and weather.<br/><br/>Temperature plays a crucial role in determining the humidity level as warmer air can hold more moisture than cooler air. When the temperature rises, the air has the ability to hold more water vapor, increasing the relative humidity. Conversely, when the temperature drops, the air becomes saturated with moisture, leading to higher humidity levels.<br/><br/>Location also impacts humidity. Coastal areas tend to have higher humidity due to the proximity to water bodies, which evaporate water and increase moisture content in the air. In contrast, inland areas often have lower humidity levels.<br/><br/>Weather conditions such as rainfall, fog, and winds can also affect humidity. Rainfall adds moisture to the air, increasing humidity, while windy conditions can decrease humidity levels.<br/>Overall, all of these factors collectively contribute to the humidity of the air.",NA
Which one of the following statements is not correct?,NA,B,The rate of evaporation depends on temperature,The rate of evaporation does not depend on surface area exposed to the atmosphere but on volume of the liquid,The rate of evaporation depends on humidity of the surroundings,The rate of evaporation depends of the wind speed,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct option is B: The statement is not correct because the rate of evaporation is influenced by both the temperature and the surface area exposed to the atmosphere.<br/><br/>Option 1 states that the rate of evaporation depends on temperature, and this is correct. Higher temperatures increase the kinetic energy of liquid particles, causing them to move faster and escape into the atmosphere as vapor.<br/>Option 3 states that the rate of evaporation depends on the humidity of the surroundings, and this is also correct. When the air is already saturated with moisture (high humidity), it becomes more difficult for water molecules to escape into the atmosphere, reducing the rate of evaporation.<br/>Option 4 states that the rate of evaporation depends on wind speed, and this is correct as well. Wind can help to remove the evaporated water particles from the surface, increasing the rate of evaporation.<br/>Therefore, the only statement that is not correct is option 2, which incorrectly states that the rate of evaporation does not depend on the surface area exposed to the atmosphere. In reality, a larger surface area allows for more liquid particles to escape, increasing the rate of evaporation.",NA
