What is the property of all material bodies due to which they naturally tend to continue in a state of rest or of uniform linear motion?,NA,A,Inertia,Friction,Momentum,Pressure,NA,NA,NA,NA,The property of all material bodies due to which they naturally tend to continue in a state of rest or of uniform linear motion is called <q>Inertia</q>. Inertia is the resistance of an object to changes in its state of motion and is measured by its mass.,NA
What type of force opposes the relative motion between two surfaces in contact with each other?,NA,D,Centripetal Force,Centrifugal Force,Gravitational Force,Frictional Force,NA,NA,NA,NA,The force that opposes the relative motion between two surfaces in contact with each other is known as <q>Frictional Force</q>. Friction is a force that acts to resist the sliding or rolling motion of objects when they are in contact with each other.,NA
"What is the pressure in a given region of space when all the fluid, which is the source of pressure, has been removed from that region?",NA,B,Atmospheric Pressure,Zero Pressure,Gauge Pressure,Absolute Pressure,NA,NA,NA,NA,"When all the fluid, which is the source of pressure, has been removed from a region of space, the pressure in that region is referred to as <q>Zero Pressure</q>. An example of this is a perfect vacuum, which has no fluid or matter to exert pressure.",NA
"What instrument is used to find the specific gravity of liquids quickly and directly without calculations, working on the principle of floatation?",NA,C,Thermometer,Barometer,Hydrometer,Manometer,NA,NA,NA,NA,A hydrometer is used to find the specific gravity of liquids quickly and directly without the need for complex calculations.

What is the term for the ratio of the weight of any volume of a substance to the weight of an equal volume of water at 4&deg;C?,NA,A,Relative Density,Absolute Density,Specific Mass,Fluidity Ratio,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Relative density, also known as specific gravity, is the ratio of the weight of any volume of a substance to the weight of an equal volume of water at 4&deg;C. It is sometimes referred to as specific gravity because it is a pure number without units.",NA
The law of floatation states that a floating body displaces what in the fluid in which it floats?,NA,B,Its own volume of fluid,Its own weight of fluid,Half of its weight of fluid,Twice its volume of fluid,NA,NA,NA,NA,"According to the law of floatation, a floating body displaces its own weight of the fluid in which it floats.",NA
Which type of hydrometer has a constant weight but variable immersion?,NA,A,Common Hydrometer,Nicholson&#39;s Hydrometer,Tweddlell&#39;s Hydrometer,Lactometer,NA,NA,NA,NA,Common hydrometers have a constant weight but variable immersion and are commonly used to measure specific gravity.,NA
Why does a ship made of iron and steel float in water while an iron nail sinks in water?,NA,B,The ship is lighter than an iron nail.,"The ship is hollow and contains air, reducing its density",The ship is smaller in size than an iron nail.,The ship is made of a different type of iron.,NA,NA,NA,NA,"A ship floats in water because it is hollow and contains air, which reduces its overall density, making it less dense than water. An iron nail, on the other hand, sinks in water because its density is greater than that of water.",NA
What happens to a submarine when its ballast tanks are filled with water?,NA,C,It rises to the surface.,It sinks deeper into the water.,It becomes more buoyant and can dive easily.,It remains stationary in the water.,NA,NA,NA,NA,"When a submarine&#39;s ballast tanks are filled with water, the average density of the submarine becomes greater than that of water, making it more buoyant and allowing it to dive easily.",NA
Why does a solid chunk of iron sink in water but float in mercury?,NA,B,Iron has a greater volume than mercury.,Mercury is denser than water.,Mercury has a lower density than iron.,Iron has a lower density than water.,NA,NA,NA,NA,A solid chunk of iron sinks in water but floats in mercury because mercury is denser than water. The density of a substance determines whether it will sink or float in a particular fluid.,NA
Why does a balloon filled with hydrogen gas rise in the air?,NA,A,Hydrogen gas is lighter than air.,Hydrogen gas is denser than air.,The balloon is made of a special material.,The balloon is pushed upwards by a fan.,NA,NA,NA,NA,"A balloon filled with hydrogen gas rises in the air because hydrogen gas is lighter than air, leading to an overall decrease in density, causing the balloon to float upward.",NA
