"In a stream, Q lies in between P and R such that it is equidistant from both P and R. A boat can go from P to Q and back in 6 hours 30 minutes while it goes from P to R in 9 hours. How long would it take to go from R to P?",NA,4 h   ,4 h   ,4.25 h,3.75 h ,4.5 h,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Since P to R is double the distance of P to Q, <br/>Therefore, it is evident that the time taken from P to R and back would be double the time taken from P to Q and back (i.e. double of 6.5 hours = 13 hours).<br/><br/>Since going from P to R takes 9 hours, coming back from R to P would take 4 hours i.e. 13- 9 = 4 <br/> Option A is correct.",NA
"If A and B together can complete a piece of work in 15 days and B alone in 20 days, in how many days can A alone complete the work?",NA,60,60,45,40,30,NA,NA,NA,NA,"A and B complete a work in = 15 days <br/> =>One day's work of (A + B) = 1/ 15 <br/>B complete the work in = 20 days <br/> => One day's work of B = 1/20 => A's one day's work = 1/15 - 1/20 = (4-3)/6 = 1/60 <br/><br/>Thus, A can complete the work in = 60 days.<br/>So Option A is correct.",NA

"Sheldon had to cover a distance of 60 km. However, he started 6 minutes later than his scheduled time and raced at a speed 1 km/h higher than his originally planned speed and reached the finish at the time he would reach it if he began to race strictly at the appointed time and raced with the assumed speed. Find the speed at which he travelled during the journey described.",NA,25 km/h ,25 km/h ,10 km/h ,6 km/h,15 km/h,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Solve this question through options. <br/>For instance, if he travelled at 25 km/h, his original speed would have been 24 km/h. <br/>The time difference can be seen to be 6 minutes in this case = 60 / 24 – 60 / 25 = 0.1 hrs = 6 mins <br/>Thus, 25 km/h is the correct answer. <br/>So Option A is correct.",NA
Two sprinters run the same race of100 m One runs at a speed of 10 m/s and the other runs at 8 m/s. By what time will the first sprinter beat the other sprinter?,NA,2.5sec,1.5 sec,2 sec,2.5sec,3 sec,NA,NA,NA,NA,Correct option is C. <br/>Time taken by first sprinter = 100/10 = 10sec <br/>Time taken by second sprinter = 100/80 = 12.5sec <br/>Difference = 12.5 - 10 = 2.5 sec,NA
X can do a piece of work in 20 days. He worked at it for 5 days and then Y finished it in 15 days. In how many days can X and Y together finish the work?,NA,10 days,12 days,15 days,10 days,5 days,NA,NA,NA,NA,"X’s five day work = 5/20 = 1/4. Remaining work = 1 – 1/4 = 3/4. <br/>This work was done by Y in 15 days.

"A dog sees a cat. It estimates that the cat is 25 leaps away. The cat sees the dog and starts running with the dog in hot pursuit. If in every minute, the dog makes 5 leaps and the cat makes 6 leaps and one leap of the dog is equal to 2 leaps of the cat. Find the time in which the cat is caught by the dog (assume an open field with no trees).",NA,12.5 minutes ,12 minutes ,15 minutes,13 minutes,12.5 minutes ,NA,NA,NA,NA,Initial distance = 25 dog leaps <br/>Per-minute dog makes 5 dog leaps and cat makes 6 cat leaps = 3 dog leaps <br/> => Relative speed = 2 dog leaps / minutes <br/> =>An initial distance of 25 dog leaps would get covered in 12.5 minutes. <br/>So Option D is correct,NA
Two cars started simultaneously towards each other and met each other 3 h 20 min later. How much time will it take the slower car to cover the whole distance if the first arrived at the place of departure of the second 5 hours later than the second arrived at the point of departure of the first?,NA,10 hours,5 hours ,10 hours,15 hours,6 hours ,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Let distance between the two places = d km <br/>Let total time taken by faster horse = t hr <br/> => Total time taken by slower horse = (t + 5) hr. <br/><br/>Therefore, <br/>Speed of the faster horse = d/t km/hr <br/>Speed of the slower horse = d/(t + 5) km/hr <br/>The two horses meet each other in 3 hour 20 min i.e. in 3(1/3) hr = 10/3 hr <br/>In this time, total distance travelled by both the horses together is d. <br/><br/>? d/(t+5) * 10/3 + d/t * 10/3 = d <br/> =>10/(3(t+5)) + 10/3t = 1 <br/> => 10t + 10(t+5) = 3t(t+5) <br/> => 20t + 50 = 3t² + 15t <br/> 3t² - 5t - 50 = 0 <br/> 3t² + 10t - 15t - 50 = 0 <br/> => t(3t + 10) - 5(3t + 10) = 0 <br/> => (3t + 10)(t - 5) = 0 <br/>=> t = 5 (ignoring -ve value) <br/>Thus, Total time taken by slower horse = 5 + 5 = 10 hr <br/>So Option B is correct.",NA
"Charlie and Alan run a race between points A and B, 5 km apart. Charlie starts at 9 a.m. from A at a speed of 5 km/hr, reaches B, and returns to A at the same speed. Alan starts at 9:45 a.m. from A at a speed of 10 km/hr, reaches B and comes back to A at the same speed.

Charlie runs at a speed of 5 km/hr, so it takes him 5 km / (5 km/hr) = 1 hour to run the distance between A and B. Alan runs at a speed of 10 km/hr, so it takes him 5 km / (10 km/hr) = 0.5 hours to run the distance between A and B. <br/><br/>Then, we can calculate the time at which each person reaches point B. Charlie starts at 9 a.m. and it takes him 1 hour to reach B, so he reaches B at 9 a.m. + 1 hour = 10 a.m. Alan starts at 9:45 a.m. and it takes him 0.5 hours to reach B, so he reaches B at 9:45 a.m. + 0.5 hours = 10:15 a.m. <br/><br/>Now Charlie is returning to point A and Alan is going towards B, so their relative speed is 10km/h.

"Two rabbits start simultaneously from two rabbit holes towards each other. The first rabbit covers 8% of the distance between the two rabbit holes in 3 hours, The second rabbit covered 7 / 120 of the distance in 2 hours 30 minutes.
