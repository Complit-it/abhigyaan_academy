Each neuron has a single long part called:,NA,B,dendrite,axon,cell body,cytoplasm,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Answer: The single long part of a neuron is called the axon. The axon is responsible for transmitting electrical signals away from the neuron&#39;s cell body to other neurons, muscles, or glands. Here is a detailed explanation of each part of a neuron: <br/>Dendrite: <br/>- Dendrites are the short, branch-like extensions of a neuron that receive signals from other neurons or sensory receptors. <br/>- They play a crucial role in collecting information from the external environment or other neurons and transmitting it to the cell body. <br/>Axon: <br/>- The axon is a long, slender extension of a neuron that carries electrical signals away from the cell body. <br/>- It is covered by a fatty substance called myelin, which helps to insulate and speed up the transmission of signals. <br/>- Axons can vary in length, with some reaching up to several feet in the human body. <br/>Cell Body: <br/>- Also known as the soma, the cell body is the main part of the neuron.<br/>- It contains the nucleus, which houses the genetic material of the neuron, and other organelles necessary for its functioning. <br/>- The cell body integrates incoming signals from dendrites and generates the electrical impulses that are transmitted through the axon. <br/>Cytoplasm:
- The cytoplasm is the gel-like substance that fills the interior of the neuron. <br/>- It contains various structures and molecules that are essential for the neuron's metabolic processes and the maintenance of its overall function. <br/>In summary, while each part of a neuron plays a crucial role in its functioning, the single long part responsible for transmitting signals away from the cell body is the axon.",NA
"Cells with evenly thickened, hard, lignified walls are seen in:",NA,B,collenchyma,sclerenchyma,striated muscle cells,parenchyma,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Cells with evenly thickened, hard, lignified walls are seen in sclerenchyma. <br/>Sclerenchyma is a type of plant tissue that provides support and strength to the plant. It is characterized by thickened, hard, and lignified cell walls. These cell walls contain a substance called lignin, which makes them tough and rigid. <br/>Key points:<br/>- Sclerenchyma cells have evenly thickened cell walls, unlike other types of plant cells. <br/>- The thickening of the cell walls is due to the deposition of lignin, a complex polymer. <br/>- Lignified cell walls provide strength and support to the plant, allowing it to withstand mechanical stress. <br/>- Sclerenchyma cells are dead at maturity and lack protoplasts. <br/>- They are found in various parts of the plant, such as the stems, roots, and seed coats. <br/><br/>In contrast: <br/>- Collenchyma cells have unevenly thickened cell walls and provide support to growing plant parts. <br/>- Striated muscle cells are found in animals and have a completely different structure and function. <br/>- Parenchyma cells are the most common type of plant cells and have thin cell walls. They are involved in various functions, such as photosynthesis and storage. <br/>Overall, the presence of evenly thickened, hard, lignified walls is a characteristic feature of sclerenchyma cells in plants.",NA
"Two slides of plant tissues, parenchyma and sclerenchyma, are shown to you. You can identify the sclerenchyma by the:",NA,D,position of nucleus,size of the cell,location of nucleus,thickness of cell wall,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Answer: <br/>The sclerenchyma can be identified by the thickness of its cell wall. The cell wall of sclerenchyma cells is significantly thicker than that of parenchyma cells. <br/><br/>Explanation: <br/>To differentiate between parenchyma and sclerenchyma tissues, you need to examine the characteristics of the cell wall. The cell wall of sclerenchyma cells is composed of lignin, which makes it thick and rigid. On the other hand, the cell wall of parenchyma cells is thin and flexible. <br/>Here are the key differences between parenchyma and sclerenchyma tissues: <br/>Parenchyma tissue: <br/>- Comprises living cells with thin and flexible cell walls. <br/>- The cell walls contain cellulose. <br/>- The cells have a large central vacuole. <br/>- The cells are generally isodiametric (similar in size in all dimensions). <br/>- The nucleus is located towards the center of the cell. <br/>- Functions include storage, photosynthesis, and secretion. <br/>Sclerenchyma tissue: <br/>- Comprises dead cells with thick and rigid cell walls. <br/>- The cell walls contain lignin.<br/>- The cells have a small central vacuole or may lack a vacuole altogether. <br/>- The cells are elongated and have tapering ends. <br/>- The nucleus is typically located towards the periphery of the cell. <br/>- Functions include support and protection. <br/>In summary, the thickness of the cell wall is the key characteristic that can be used to identify sclerenchyma tissue in comparison to parenchyma tissue.",NA

Plant cells with thickened walls at corners and non-lignified cell walls are seen in:,NA,B,Parenchyma,Collenchyma,Aerenchyma,Epidermal cell,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Plant cells with thickened walls at corners and non-lignified cell walls are seen in collenchyma. <br/>Collenchyma cells are a type of ground tissue found in plants. They have a thickened primary cell wall, particularly at the corners, which provides support and flexibility to the plant. The cell walls of collenchyma cells are primarily made up of cellulose and pectin, and they lack lignin, which is responsible for the hardening and lignification of cell walls. <br/>Here are the key characteristics of collenchyma cells: <br/>1. Thickened walls at corners: The corners of collenchyma cells have extra layers of cell wall material, making them stronger and able to withstand mechanical stress. <br/>2. Non-lignified cell walls: Unlike other types of cells, such as xylem cells, collenchyma cells do not contain lignin. This lack of lignification allows the cell walls to remain flexible and stretchable, contributing to the plant's ability to grow and adapt. <br/>3. Support and flexibility: The primary function of collenchyma cells is to provide support to young and growing parts of the plant. The thickened cell walls at the corners and the absence of lignin allow them to provide structural support while still being flexible enough to accommodate growth. <br/>In conclusion, cells with thickened walls at corners and non-lignified cell walls are characteristic of collenchyma cells in plants.",NA

Analyse the statements and pick up the right one regarding mitochondrial membranes from the following :,NA,A,The outer membrane is porous while the inner membrane is deeply folded,The outer membrane is longer than the inner membrane,Both the inner and the outer membranes are almost equal in length,Mostly mitochondria have a single membrane,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analysis of Mitochondrial Membranes <br/><br/>- Outer Mitochondrial Membrane: The outer mitochondrial membrane is quite porous because of the presence of many integral proteins known as porins. These proteins form channels that allow the free diffusion of molecules and ions up to a certain size, including small proteins. <br/><br/>- Inner Mitochondrial Membrane: The inner mitochondrial membrane is deeply folded, forming structures known as cristae. These folds increase the surface area of the membrane, thereby enhancing the ability of the mitochondria to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is the energy currency of the cell. <br/><br/>- Length of Membranes: The statement that the outer membrane is longer than the inner membrane is not correct. The length of the membranes is not a distinct feature of mitochondria. Instead, the inner membrane has more surface area due to its folds or cristae. <br/><br/>- Number of Membranes: Mitochondria are double-membraned organelles. They have an outer membrane and an inner membrane, separated by an intermembrane space. The statement that mitochondria mostly have a single membrane is incorrect. <br/><br/>So, based on the analysis, the correct statement regarding mitochondrial membranes is ""The outer membrane is porous while the inner membrane is deeply folded"".the inner membrane has more curls and turns compared to outer membrane , you can also take reference of brain(it has many curls and turns(neurons) and many experts say that our brains' neurons are much longer in length of our inner intestine(inner intestine measures 7 meters)).",NA
