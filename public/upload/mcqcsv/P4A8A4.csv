"Normally, the temperature decreases with the increase in height from the Earth&#39;s surface, because <br/><br/>1. the atmosphere can be heated upwards only from the Earth&#39;s surface <br/>2. there is more moisture in the upper atmosphere <br/>3. the air is less dense in the upper atmosphere <br/>Select the correct answer using the codes given below :",NA,C,1 only,2 and 3 only,1 and 3 only,"1, 2 and 3",NA,NA,NA,NA,"The temperature decreases as the height from the Earth&#39;s surface increases due to two reasons mentioned in options 1 and 3. <br/><br/>Option 1 is correct as the heating of the atmosphere happens mainly from the Earth&#39;s surface. The sun heats the earth&#39;s surface, which in turn heats the surrounding air causing it to rise, consequently cooling the air at higher altitudes.<br/>Option 3 is also correct because as altitude increases, the air becomes less dense. This lower density means fewer air molecules to absorb and re-radiate heat, therefore the temperature decreases.<br/>Option 2 is incorrect as the presence of moisture doesn&#39;t influence the temperature gradient with altitude. Typically, the amount of moisture in the form of water vapor decreases with altitude, not increases.<br/><br/>Hence, option C :  <q>1 and 3 only</q> is the correct answer.",NA

Consider the following : <br/>1. Pyroclastic debris <br/>2. Ash and dust <br/>3. Nitrogen compounds <br/>4. Sulphur compounds <br/><br/>How many of the above are products of volcanic eruptions?,NA,D,Only 1,Only 2,Only 3,All four,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Volcanic eruptions produce various materials, and among the listed items, the following are products of volcanic eruptions:<br/><b>Pyroclastic debris:</b> These are fragments of rock erupted by a volcano, including pumice, ash, and volcanic bombs. Pyroclastic flows are fast-moving currents of hot gas and volcanic matter.<br/><b>Ash and dust:</b> Volcanic ash and dust are fine particles of pulverized rock, minerals, and volcanic glass created during volcanic eruptions. These particles can be ejected into the atmosphere and carried over long distances.<br/><b>Sulphur compounds:</b> Volcanic eruptions release various gases, including sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and hydrogen sulphide (H<sub>2</sub>S). These sulphur compounds can have significant environmental and climatic effects.<br/><b>Nitrogen compounds:</b> Volcanoes belched the gases that formed Earth&#39;s atmosphere. Those volcanoes could have also spurred lightning that fixed nitrogen, freeing it from nitrogen gas to form nitrogen-containing molecules that living things can use. <br/><br/>Hence, Option 4 is the correct answer.",NA
The earth&#39;s plate responsible for causing earthquakes is,NA,A,the crust of the earth,the mantle of the earth,the inner core of the earth,the outer core of the earth,NA,NA,NA,NA,"<b>The crust of the earth:</b><br/>The crust is the outermost layer of the Earth, and it is divided into several large and small tectonic plates. These plates constantly move, although very slowly, and their interactions cause earthquakes. When these plates grind against each other or collide, they release energy in the form of seismic waves, leading to earthquakes. <br/><br/>Additional Information<br/><br/><u>The mantle of the earth:</u> The mantle lies beneath the Earth&#39;s crust and extends to a depth of about 2,900 kilometers. While it is involved in the movement of tectonic plates through convection currents, it is not directly responsible for causing earthquakes.<br/><br/><u>The inner core of the earth:</u> The inner core is the Earth&#39;s innermost layer, composed primarily of iron and nickel, and it is solid. It does not play a direct role in the tectonic activities that lead to earthquakes.<br/><br/><u>The outer core of the earth:</u> The outer core surrounds the inner core and is in a liquid state, composed mainly of iron and nickel. Like the inner core, it does not directly contribute to the occurrence of earthquakes.",NA

These zones are not boundaries of tectonic plates but rather regions where seismic activity is frequent.<br/>Earth&#39;s Mantle: The mantle is the layer of the Earth between the crust and the core. It is not a boundary but plays a crucial role in plate tectonics through convection currents.<br/>Inner Core: The inner core is the Earth&#39;s innermost part, primarily composed of iron and nickel.
