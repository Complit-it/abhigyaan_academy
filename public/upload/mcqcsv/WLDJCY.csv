Which one of the following is a planetary wind?,NA,B,Monsoon,Trade,Chinook,Mistral,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Option 1: Monsoon. Monsoon winds are seasonal winds that occur mainly in South Asia. They are caused by the differential heating of land and sea. Although monsoon winds are significant and have a great impact on the climate and rainfall patterns in the region, they are not considered planetary winds.<br/><br/>Option 2: Trade. Trade winds are a type of planetary wind. They blow from the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere and from the southeast in the Southern Hemisphere. The name <q>trade winds</q> comes from the historical trading routes used by sailors to cross the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. These winds are consistent and play a major role in global weather patterns.<br/><br/>Option 3: Chinook. Chinook winds are warm, dry winds that occur in the Rocky Mountains of North America. They are caused by a downslope airflow, resulting in the warming and drying of the air due to compression. Chinook winds are not planetary winds; instead, they are localized phenomena.<br/><br/>Option 4: Mistral. Mistral winds are strong, cold winds that blow from the northwest in the Rhone Valley in France. They are a localized wind phenomenon and are not considered planetary winds.<br/><br/>Therefore, the correct answer is Option 2: Trade, as trade winds are one of the major types of planetary wind.",NA

Which one among the following statements regarding Chinook winds is not correct?,NA,C,These are local winds,They descend along the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountain in mid-latitudes,They bring lots of rain with them,They benefit agriculture,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The statement in option 3, <q>They bring lots of rain with them,</q> is not correct. Chinook winds are warm, dry winds that occur on the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains in mid-latitudes. They are not associated with bringing lots of rain.<br/><br/>Option 1 states that Chinook winds are local winds, which is correct. Local winds are winds that occur on a small scale and are influenced by local geographic features.<br/><br/>Option 2 correctly states that Chinook winds descend along the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains in mid-latitudes. As the winds move down the mountain slopes, they can warm up and lose moisture, resulting in dry and warm conditions in the areas they affect.<br/><br/>Option 4 correctly states that Chinook winds benefit agriculture. Due to their warm and dry nature, Chinook winds can help melt snow quickly, allowing farmers to start planting earlier in the growing season. They can also prevent frost damage to crops.<br/><br/>In summary, the only incorrect statement is that Chinook winds bring lots of rain. They are warm, dry winds that benefit agriculture by melting snow and preventing frost damage.",NA
Which one among the following statements regarding Chinook winds is not correct?,NA,C,They rise from the Pacific Ocean,"After the Rockies, they descend to the east of the mountains",They bring rainfall in the Prairies,These winds are beneficial to wheat cultivation,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Option 1: Chinook winds do indeed rise from the Pacific Ocean. Due to the unique topography of the Rocky Mountains, these winds are forced upwards and over the mountain range.<br/><br/>Option 2: After crossing the Rockies, Chinook winds descend to the east of the mountains. As the winds move over the mountains, they cool and release moisture, resulting in drier air on the eastern side.<br/><br/>Option 3: This statement is not correct. Chinook winds do not bring rainfall in the Prairies. In fact, these winds are known for their warm and dry characteristics, often leading to rapid melting of snow and causing winter temperatures to rise.<br/><br/>Option 4: Chinook winds are indeed beneficial to wheat cultivation. These winds help to melt snow and ice, allowing winter wheat crops to sprout earlier in the year. Additionally, the warm and dry nature of Chinook winds can help reduce disease and pest pressure on wheat fields.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the statement that is not correct regarding Chinook winds is option 3, as these winds do not bring rainfall in the Prairies.",NA
Consider the following statements regarding El Nino effect on Indian monsoon:<br/>1. The surface temperature goes up in the Southern Pacific Ocean and there is dificient rainfall in India.<br/>2. The Walker Circulation shifts Eastward from its normal position and reduces monsoon rainfall in India.<br/>Which of the statement(s) given above is/are correct?,NA,A,Only 1,Only 2,Both 1 and 2,Neither 1 nor 2,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option 1 - Only 1.<br/><br/>Explanation:<br/>1. The first statement is correct. During El Nino, there is a rise in the surface temperature of the Southern Pacific Ocean. This increase in temperature disrupts the normal patterns of atmospheric circulation and weather systems. As a result, it leads to deficient rainfall in India during the monsoon season.<br/><br/>2. The second statement is incorrect. The Walker Circulation is a set of atmospheric circulation cells that helps drive the Indian monsoon. During El Nino, the Walker Circulation weakens rather than shifts eastward. This weakening of the Walker Circulation affects the normal rainfall patterns in the Indian subcontinent, leading to a deficit in monsoon rainfall.<br/>Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, and statement 2 is incorrect.",NA
"Hot deserts like Sahara, Arabia etc. receive very negligible amount of rainfall. This is because they :",NA,C,do not receive moisture-bearing wind from the oceans.,are the most rocky and barren areas of the Earth.,are located on the tropical high pressure belt of the atmosphere,are not on the path of the monsoons.,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Option 1 states that hot deserts do not receive moisture-bearing wind from the oceans. This is partly true. Deserts are typically located far away from the coastlines, where the chances of moisture-bearing winds reaching them are significantly lower. However, it is not the only reason for the negligible amount of rainfall in deserts.<br/><br/>Option 2 mentions that deserts are the most rocky and barren areas of the Earth. While deserts are indeed characterized by their barrenness and lack of vegetation, it is not the main reason for the low rainfall. The lack of rainfall is primarily caused by other factors.<br/><br/>Option 3 correctly states that hot deserts are located on the tropical high-pressure belt of the atmosphere. This high-pressure belt prevents the uplift of moist air, which inhibits the formation of clouds and rainfall.<br/><br/>Option 4 suggests that hot deserts are not on the path of monsoons. This statement is correct. Monsoons are seasonal winds that bring heavy rainfall to certain regions. However, deserts are usually not located in the path of these monsoons, resulting in little to no rainfall.<br/><br/>In conclusion, option 3 is the correct explanation for why hot deserts like Sahara and Arabia receive a negligible amount of rainfall.",NA
The climate of India is mainly tropical because,NA,A,Of the location of the Himalayas in its North,Major part of India lies within the tropics,Of the over-powering influence of the Indian Ocean,Of the seasonal influence of jet streams,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option 1: <q>Of the location of the Himalayas in its North</q>.<br/>The climate of a region is influenced by various factors, and in the case of India, the presence of the Himalayas in the north plays a significant role in determining its climate. The Himalayas act as a barrier, preventing the cold winds from Central Asia from entering India, thus protecting it from extreme cold temperatures. This leads to a relatively warmer climate throughout most of India.",NA
Extensive deserts occur in the Western Tropical Regions of Continents because,NA,C,of easterly trade winds,gold ocean currents flwo along the western coasts,of the effect of both the off shore eaterly trade winds and cold currents,the rate of exploration is greater along the western margin areas,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option C, which states that extensive deserts occur in the Western Tropical Regions of Continents because of the effect of both offshore easterly trade winds and cold ocean currents.<br/><br/>Let us dissect the other options to understand why they are incorrect:<br/>Option A suggests that extensive deserts occur due to easterly trade winds. While easterly trade winds do exist in the Western Tropical Regions, they are not the sole reason for the occurrence of deserts.<br/>Option B suggests that gold ocean currents flow along the western coasts, causing extensive deserts. However, there is no such thing as <q>gold ocean currents</q>, and the presence of ocean currents does not directly result in the formation of deserts.<br/>Option 4 states that the rate of exploration is greater along the western margin areas, leading to extensive deserts. However, exploration has no direct impact on the formation of deserts in the Western Tropical Regions.<br/><br/>Therefore, option C provides the most accurate explanation as it considers the combined effect of offshore easterly trade winds and cold ocean currents in the occurrence of extensive deserts in the Western Tropical Regions of Continents.",NA
Which of the following statements is/are correct?<br/>1. The jet streams are high altitude easterly winds.<br/>2. El Nino is a warm ocean current.<br/>3. El Nino appears along the Peru coast.<br/>Select the correct answer using the code given below.,NA,B,1 only,2 and 3 only,1 and 3 only,"1, 2 and 3",NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option 2, indicating that statements 2 and 3 are correct.<br/><br/>Statement 1: The jet streams are high altitude easterly winds - This statement is incorrect. Jet streams are fast flowing, narrow air currents found in the atmosphere at around 9 km above the surface of the Earth. They are predominantly west to east, not easterly winds.<br/><br/>Statement 2: El Nino is a warm ocean current - This is correct. El Nino is a climate pattern where the sea surface temperature in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean is higher than average.<br/><br/>Statement 3: El Nino appears along the Peru coast - This is also correct. El Nino events usually form in the Pacific Ocean, and they can have a big impact on the weather in South America, including the coast of Peru, causing higher than usual rainfall.<br/><br/>Therefore, the statements 2 and 3 are correct, making option 2 the correct answer.",NA
The Gulf Stream is a poleward flowing current in the Atlantic Ocean.<br/>Which one of the following statements with regard to this is not correct?,NA,D,It is similar to the Kuroshio current in the North Pacific Ocean,"It transports warm, tropical water towards polar region.",This current is a major factor in weather along the east coast of the USA.,The warm water of the Gulf Stream sustains the coral reefs of West Pacific Coast.,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The Gulf Stream is a significant poleward flowing current in the Atlantic Ocean. It transports warm, tropical water from the Gulf of Mexico towards the polar region. This current is a major factor in determining the weather patterns along the east coast of the USA.<br/><br/>Option 1 states that the Gulf Stream is similar to the Kuroshio current in the North Pacific Ocean. This statement is correct. Both the Gulf Stream and the Kuroshio current are warm, poleward flowing currents that have similar functions in their respective oceans.<br/><br/>Option 2 correctly identifies that the Gulf Stream transports warm, tropical water towards the polar region. This statement is correct and in line with the characteristics of the Gulf Stream.<br/><br/>Option 3 accurately states that the Gulf Stream is a major factor in the weather along the east coast of the USA. This is because the warm water from the Gulf Stream influences the temperature and moisture levels in the surrounding atmosphere.<br/><br/>Option 4, however, is incorrect. The warm water of the Gulf Stream does not sustain the coral reefs of the West Pacific Coast. Coral reefs are found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions, mainly in the Indo-Pacific Ocean. The warm waters of the Gulf Stream do not reach the Pacific coast.",NA
During the Indian monsoon season,NA,B,the westerly jet stream alone exists in the Indian region,the easterly jet stream alone exists in the Indian region,both westerly and easterly jet streams exist in the Indian region,both westerly and easterly jet streams disappear,NA,NA,NA,NA,"During the Indian monsoon season, the correct answer is option 2 - the easterly jet stream alone exists in the Indian region.<br/>Jet streams are narrow, fast-moving air currents in the upper atmosphere. In the Indian region, there are two main jet streams known as the westerly and easterly jet streams.<br/>The westerly jet stream exists during the winter months, bringing cold air from the western regions towards the Indian subcontinent. However, during the monsoon season, the westerly jet stream weakens and moves towards the north, causing it to no longer exist in the Indian region.<br/>On the other hand, the easterly jet stream becomes dominant during the monsoon season. It brings warm and moist air from the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea towards the Indian subcontinent, resulting in heavy rainfall and the monsoon season.<br/>Therefore, option 2 is correct as only the easterly jet stream exists in the Indian region during the monsoon season.",NA

Doldrums is a,NA,D,Tropical wind belts,Tropical wind deflection belt,Sub-tropical wind belt,Tropical no wind belt,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option 4: Tropical no-wind belt. The doldrums refer to a region near the equator characterized by calm and light winds. In this area, the trade winds from the northern and southern hemispheres converge, causing a region of low pressure where the air is rising. As the air rises, it cools and condenses, leading to frequent cloud cover and precipitation. The lack of strong winds in this region makes it difficult for sailing ships to navigate, leading to the term <q>doldrums</q> being used to describe a state of boredom or inactivity. It is important to note that while there may still be some light winds in the doldrums, they are generally not strong or consistent enough to be relied upon for sailing purposes. Therefore, option 4 accurately describes the doldrums as a tropical no-wind belt.",NA
