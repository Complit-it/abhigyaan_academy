In this question, we are asked to identify which option is not an institution of the Indian Money Market.<br/><br/>Option 1: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the central bank of India and plays a significant role in the Indian Money Market. The RBI regulates and controls the money supply in the economy and acts as a lender of last resort for commercial banks.<br/>Option 2: Bill brokers are intermediaries who deal in money market instruments such as Treasury Bills, commercial bills, and other short-term debt instruments. They facilitate the buying and selling of these instruments in the money market.<br/>Option 3: Merchant bankers are financial institutions that help companies raise capital and provide advisory services for various financial transactions.

This means that the RBI manages the country&#39;s foreign currency assets, including maintaining a reserve of foreign currencies to ensure stability in international trade and manage exchange rate fluctuations.<br/>Option D states that the RBI regulates credit in the country. This means that the RBI sets guidelines and policies that govern and control the lending and borrowing activities of banks and financial institutions. It establishes credit control measures to manage inflation, stabilize the economy, and ensure the stability of the financial system.<br/><br/>Therefore, only option 3 does not align with the functions of the RBI.

NBFCs can, and often do, borrow from banks as a part of their operations.<br/>Option D, the correct answer, says that NBFCs cannot seek demand deposits from the public and cannot issue cheques. This is indeed the case. NBFCs don&#39;t have the same powers as banks, they cannot accept demand deposits (deposits repayable on demand) from the public or provide cheque-book facilities to their customers as they are not part of the payment and settlement system.
