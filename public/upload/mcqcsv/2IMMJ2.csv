Oceanic tides are the smallest on the,NA,C,full moon day,new moon day,8th a day of the waxing moon.,None of the above,NA,NA,NA,NA,"This is because, during this period, the Moon and Sun are at a right angle with Earth, partially canceling each other's gravitational pull on the oceans.<br/>This results in less pronounced high and low tides, known as neap tides.<br/>Full moon day: This is the time of the highest tides, called spring tides, due to the combined gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun aligned with Earth.<br/>New moon day: Same as the full moon, neap tides do not occur on the new moon day.<br/>3rd day of the waning moon: This is not a specific timing associated with neap tides. The size of tides fluctuates throughout the lunar cycle, with neap tides occurring roughly around the first and third quarters of the moon.<br/>Hence, we can conclude that Oceanic tides are the smallest on the 8th day of the waxing moon.",NA
The rhythmic rise and fall of ocean water twice in a day is called ______.,NA,D,Wave,Tsunami,Current,Tide,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The rhythmic rise and fall of the ocean twice a day is called a tide. <br/>-The intense gravitational force exerted by the sun and the moon on the surface of the earth induce tides.<br/><br/>Additional Information:<br/>When water covers most of the shore by rising to its maximum level, it is known as high tide. <br/>It is low tide as the waterfalls to its lowest level and recedes from the sea.<br/>The water of Earth closer to the moon is drawn under the influence of the gravitational force of the moon which creates a high tide.<br/>The sun, the moon, and the earth are in the same line during the full moon and new moon days and the tides are highest. These tides are called the spring tides.<br/>But when the moon is in its first and last quarter, the ocean waters are drawn in diagonally opposite directions through the gravitational force of the sun and earth resulting in low tides. These tides are called neap tides.<br/>High tides help in navigation as they raise the level of water closer to the coast. This makes it easier for ships to enter the harbour.<br/>High tides assist with fishing as well as much more fish, move closer to the sea during the high tide. This helps fishermen to have an abundant harvest.<br/>The rise and fall of water due to tides is being used in some places to generate electricity.",NA
