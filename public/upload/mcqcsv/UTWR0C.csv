Which of the following substances is a compound?,NA,C,Air,Saltwater,Carbon dioxide (CO2),Sugar,NA,NA,NA,NA,Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a compound because it consists of two different kinds of atoms (carbon and oxygen) chemically bonded together.,NA
How are mixtures different from compounds?,NA,B,"Mixtures involve chemical bonding, while compounds do not.","Mixtures cannot be separated into their individual components, while compounds can.","Mixtures have properties that change when combined, while compounds do not.","Mixtures consist of only one type of atom, while compounds consist of multiple types of atoms.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Mixtures can be separated into their individual components using physical methods, whereas compounds cannot be separated into their constituent atoms by simple physical methods.",NA
Which of the following is an example of a mixture?,NA,C,Sodium chloride (NaCl),Oxygen (O2),Sand and water,Carbon dioxide (CO2),NA,NA,NA,NA,A mixture is formed when two or more substances are physically combined without any chemical bonding between them. Sand and water represent a mixture of two distinct substances mixed together without a chemical reaction.,NA
Who developed the first detailed form of the periodic table based on mass number?,NA,B,James Chadwick,Dmitri Mendeleev,Henry Gwyn Jeffreys Moseley,J.J. Thomson,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Dmitri Mendeleev developed the first detailed periodic table based on the mass number of elements, which was a significant milestone in the organization of chemical elements.",NA
An element contains,NA,A,One type of atom only,100 different elements,Element,Chemical formula for water,NA,NA,NA,NA,"An element is a pure substance consisting of only one type of atom which all have the same numbers of protons in their nuclei.<br/>This unique number of protons is what defines the element. For example, all atoms of the element carbon have 6 protons in their nucleus.<br/>When atoms of different elements combine, they form compounds. Compounds are substances composed of two or more different elements chemically bonded together in fixed proportions. In a compound, the atoms of different elements are not the same, unlike in an element where all atoms are identical.",NA
Atoms of each element are represented by a,NA,D,formation of one or more new substances,element,two or more elements chemically combined,chemical symbol,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Atoms of each element are represented by their own chemical symbol. A chemical symbol is a one- or two-letter designation of an element; always starts with a capital letter, with any other letter in lower case.",NA
O represents,NA,B,do not involve chemical reactions,an atom of oxygen,one type of atom only,100 different elements,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Oxygen is a chemical element - a substance that contains only one type of atom. Its official chemical symbol is O, and its atomic number is 8, which means that an oxygen atom has eight protons in its nucleus. Oxygen is a gas at room temperature and has no colour, smell or taste. Oxygen is found naturally as a molecule.",NA
Compounds are formed from elements by,NA,C,mixture,elements can react together,chemical reactions,no new substances,NA,NA,NA,NA,When two or more elements are combined through a chemical reaction then a compound is formed. Complex molecules such as proteins are formed by a series of reactions involving elements and simple compounds.,NA
Chemical reactions always involve the,NA,C,an atom of sodium,an atom of oxygen,formation of one or more new substances,separated by physical processes,NA,NA,NA,NA,Chemical reactions involve interaction between chemicals such that all reactants are changed into new materials. The properties of the new materials are different from those of the reactants.<br/>Chemical reactions involve breaking chemical bonds between reactant molecules (particles) and forming new bonds between atoms in product particles (molecules). The number of atoms before and after the chemical change is the same but the number of molecules will change.,NA
Water is a ______________ formed by chemical reaction of the elements: oxygen and hydrogen,NA,A,compound,"Mixtures cannot be separated into their individual components, while compounds can.",an atom of oxygen,chemical symbol,NA,NA,NA,NA,"A compound forms whenever two or more atoms form chemical bonds with each other. The chemical formula for water is H2O, which means each molecule of water consists of one oxygen atom chemically bonded to two hydrogen atoms. Thus, water is a compound. <br/>It&#39;s also a molecule, which is any chemical species formed by two or more atoms chemically bonded to each other. The terms <q>molecule</q> and <q>compound</q> mean the same thing and can be used interchangeably.",NA
Compounds contain ____________________ in fixed proportions,NA,B,chemical formula for water,two or more elements chemically combined,only be separated,involve a detectable energy change,NA,NA,NA,NA,A compound is a substance that contains two or moe different type of atom chemically bonded together,NA
A mixture consists of ______________ not chemically combined together,NA,D,only be separated,chemical properties are unchanged,involve a detectable energy change,two or more elements or compounds,NA,NA,NA,NA,"A mixture is a physical blend of two or more substances that preserve their identities and are blended in the form of solutions, suspensions, or colloids. <br/>-The result formed due to the combination of substances does not lose its individuality nor are they combined chemically.<br/>- Mixtures are the one product of a mechanical blending or mixing of chemical substances such as elements and compounds.<br/><br/>Mixtures are unlike chemical compounds, because: <br/>The substances in a mixture can be separated using physical methods such as filtration, freezing, and distillation.<br/>There is little or no energy change when a mixture forms.<br/>-Mixtures have variable compositions, while compounds have a fixed, definite formula.<br/>-When mixed, individual substances keep their properties in a mixture, while if they form a compound their properties can change.",NA
