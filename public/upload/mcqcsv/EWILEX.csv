What are the three parts of a comet?,NA,B,"The head, body, and tail","The nucleus, coma, and tail","The nucleus, protons, and electrons",All the above,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Comets are composed of three main parts: the nucleus, coma, and tail. The nucleus is the solid core of the comet, consisting of ice, dust, and rocky materials. As a comet approaches the Sun, the heat causes the nucleus to vaporize and release gas and dust, creating a glowing cloud called the coma. The coma surrounds the nucleus and can be quite large. The tail of a comet is formed as the solar wind pushes the gas and dust away from the coma in a direction opposite to the Sun. This creates a glowing trail that can extend for millions of kilometers.",NA
What is a comet made of?,NA,A,"Ice made from frozen gases, water, and dust",Moon dust,Fire and ice,Both 2 and 3,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Comets are made primarily of ice, which is composed of frozen gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and ammonia, along with water ice. These gases and water ice are mixed with dust particles, creating a dusty and icy composition. This combination of frozen gases, water, and dust gives comets their characteristic appearance when they approach the Sun and start to vaporize, creating a glowing coma and a tail.",NA
Which comet is often considered the most famous?,NA,B,Holly&#39;s comet,Halley&#39;s comet,Giotto&#39;s comet,Comet Hyakutake,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Halley&#39;s comet is often considered the most famous comet because it is the most well-known and widely observed comet in human history. It is named after the English astronomer Edmond Halley, who calculated its orbit and predicted its return. Halley&#39;s comet has a highly elliptical orbit, and it returns to the inner solar system approximately every 76 years. Its last appearance was in 1986, and it is expected to be visible again in 2061. The comet&#39;s regular and predictable returns, combined with its brightness and visibility, have made it a popular and iconic celestial event.",NA
Which is the biggest comet ever recorded in the solar system?,NA,D,Halley&#39;s comet,Halle Bopp Comet,C/2002 VQ94 (Linear),Comet Bernardinelli-Bernstein,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Comet Bernardinelli-Bernstein, the largest comet ever discovered, has a nucleus that is approximately 119 kilometers across. <br/><br/>Comet C/2014 UN271 (Bernardinelli-Bernstein) was discovered by astronomers Pedro Bernardinelli and Gary Bernstein in archival images from the Dark Energy Survey at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. It was first serendipitously observed in November 2010, when it was a whopping 3 billion miles from the Sun, which is nearly the average distance to Neptune. Since then, it has been intensively studied by ground and space-based telescopes.",NA
What are asteroids?,NA,C,Pieces of stars,Small planets,Large rock-like chunks with some metals that orbit the sun,None of the above,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Asteroids are large rock-like chunks with some metals that orbit the sun. They are remnants from the early formation of our solar system, often referred to as <q>space rocks</q>. They are smaller than planets and do not have a regular shape like a small planet would.

What is the asteroid belt?,NA,A,An area between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where most asteroids are found,A belt of rocks across a planet,A belt of rocks crossing the sun,Debris,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The asteroid belt is an area located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. This region is known for containing a large number of asteroids. These asteroids are rocky objects that vary in size, ranging from small boulders to dwarf planets. The gravitational forces from Mars and Jupiter have prevented these asteroids from coalescing into a single planet, resulting in the formation of the asteroid belt.",NA
Meteors are bright streaks of light and smoke that are heated by:,NA,D,Air condensation,Air friction,Air compression,Both B and C,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Meteors heat up and produce a bright streak of light as they enter the Earth&#39;s atmosphere due to air friction and air compression.<br/>When a meteoroid (a small particle from a comet or asteroid) enters the Earth&#39;s atmosphere, it encounters a tremendous amount of resistance or friction from the air. This friction causes the meteoroid to heat up, and it starts to glow, creating the bright streak we see as a meteor.<br/>In addition to friction, the air in front of the meteoroid gets compressed. When a gas is compressed, its temperature rises. This compression of air also contributes to the heating of the meteoroid.<br/>So, both air friction and air compression play significant roles in heating meteors as they pass through the Earth&#39;s atmosphere.",NA
Meteoroids are:,NA,B,Chunks of ice made up of dust and water,Chunks of metallic stony matter,Dirtball made of ice and dust,Luminous balls of plasma,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Meteoroids are small rocky or metallic objects in space that are smaller than asteroids. They are typically composed of a combination of metal and stone, hence the term <q>chunks of metallic stony matter</q>. These meteoroids can vary in size and can be found in various regions of the solar system. When they enter the Earth's atmosphere and burn up, they are known as meteors.",NA

When frozen, they are the size of a small town. When a comet&#39;s orbit brings it close to the Sun, it heats up and spews dust and gases into a giant glowing head larger than most planets.",NA

They reside in dynamically stable zones 60deg. ahead and behind Jupiter. These positions are the last two of the five Lagrangian points, named by the 19th-century mathematician J. L. Lagrange. <br/><br/>The Trojan asteroids move in the same orbit as Jupiter, though they keep either well ahead of or well behind the Giant Planet and are in no danger of being engulfed.

Processed meteorites are fragments of larger asteroids and therefore can be metallic like a planet's core or rocky like its mantle or crust.",NA
