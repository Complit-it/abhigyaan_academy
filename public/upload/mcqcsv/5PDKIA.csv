Radiocarbon dating technique is used to estimate the age of,NA,D,rocks,monuments,soil,fossil,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is Fossils.<br/><br/>About Radiocarbon Dating Technique:<br/>- Radiocarbon Dating is used to estimate the Age of Fossils. The scientists combined Several Well Tested Techniques to find out the Ages and Compositions of Fossils. The method was developed at the University of Chicago by Willard Libby in the late 1940s. <br/>- The most important techniques are Relative Dating, in which Fossils and Layers of rock are placed in order from Older to Younger ages, and in Radiometric Dating, which allows the actual ages of Certain Types of Rock to be calculated their ages.<br/>- This technique helps in determining the Ages of an Ancient Fossil or Specimen by Measuring Fossils Carbon-14 content.<br/>- Radiocarbon or Carbon-14 is a naturally occurring Radioactive Isotope that forms when Cosmic Rays in the upper atmosphere strike nitrogen (NO2) molecules, which then oxidize to become Carbon Dioxide.",NA
