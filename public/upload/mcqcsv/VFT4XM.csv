Which of the following is the source of respiration -,NA,A,Glucose from stored food,Fats,Minerals,Proteins,NA,NA,NA,NA,Cellular respiration allows organisms to use energy stored in the chemical bonds of glucose. The energy in glucose is used to produce  ATP. Cells use ATP to supply their energy needs. Cellular respiration is therefore a process in which the energy in glucose is transferred to ATP.,NA

Respiratory structures in the insects are,NA,D,Gills,Skin,Lungs,Trachea,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Insects and some other invertebrates exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide between their tissues and the air by a system of air-filled tubes called tracheae. Tracheae open to the outside through small holes called spiracles. Spiracles open into large tracheal tubes. These, in turn, lead to ever-finer branches. The branches penetrate to every part of the body. At their extreme ends, called tracheoles, they may be less than 1 m in diameter and are probably filled with liquid. Every cell in the insect&#39;s body is adjacent to, or very close to, the end of a tracheole.",NA

The exchange of gases [O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>] in a mammal takes place in,NA,D,Trachea,Bronchi,Bronchioles,Alveoli,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Answer is D- Alveoli.<br/>Exchange of gases in a mammal: The exchange of gases, specifically oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), in a mammal takes place in the alveoli.<br/><br/>Trachea: The trachea is responsible for conducting air to and from the lungs, but it does not participate in the exchange of gases.<br/>Bronchi: The bronchi are the main air passages in the lungs, but they do not directly participate in the exchange of gases.<br/>Bronchioles: Bronchioles are smaller branches of the bronchi that lead to the alveoli. While they play a role in directing air to the alveoli, they do not directly participate in gas exchange.<br/>Alveoli: The alveoli are tiny air sacs located at the end of the bronchioles. They are the primary site of gas exchange in the respiratory system. Oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses across the thin walls of the alveoli into the bloodstream, while carbon dioxide diffuses from the bloodstream into the alveoli to be exhaled.",NA

The structure which prevent the entry of food into respiratory tract is,NA,D,Pharynx,Larynx,Glottis,Epiglottis,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The structure that prevents the entry of food into the respiratory tract is the epiglottis.<br/><br/>Explanation:<br/>The respiratory and digestive systems share a common pathway in the throat or pharynx. However, to prevent food from entering the respiratory tract, several structures work together to ensure proper passage of air and food. The epiglottis is one such structure that plays a crucial role in preventing the entry of food into the respiratory tract.<br/>Here&#39;s how it functions:<br/>- The epiglottis is a flap-like structure located at the base of the tongue.<br/>- During swallowing, the epiglottis moves down and covers the opening of the larynx, which leads to the respiratory tract.<br/>- This movement of the epiglottis ensures that food or liquid is directed towards the esophagus, the passage that leads to the stomach, rather than entering the larynx and trachea.<br/>- Once the food has safely passed through the pharynx, the epiglottis returns to its upright position, allowing normal respiration to resume.",NA

"In respiration, air passes through ",NA,B,Pharynx --> Nasal cavity --> Larynx --> Trachea --> Bronchi --> Bronchiole --> Lungs,Nasal cavity --> Pharynx --> Larynx --> Trachea --> Bronchi --> Bronchiole --> Lungs,Larynx --> Nasal cavity --> Pharynx --> Trachea --> Lungs,Larynx --> Pharynx --> Trachea --> Lungs,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is B: Nasal cavity --> Pharynx --> Larynx --> Trachea --> Bronchi --> Bronchiole --> Lungs. This respiratory pathway ensures that the inhaled air is properly filtered, warmed, and reaches the lungs for efficient gas exchange. <br/>Explanation:<br/>The respiratory pathway involves the movement of air from the external environment into the lungs. It can be summarized as follows: <br/>1. Nasal Cavity: The process begins in the nasal cavity, where air enters the respiratory system through the nostrils. The nasal cavity is lined with cilia and mucus that help filter and warm the inhaled air.<br/>2. Pharynx: From the nasal cavity, the air moves to the pharynx, also known as the throat. The pharynx serves as a common passage for both air and food.<br/>3. Larynx: Next, the air enters the larynx, commonly known as the voice box. The larynx contains the vocal cords and plays a crucial role in producing sound.<br/>4. Trachea: The air then passes through the trachea, a tube-like structure commonly known as the windpipe. The trachea is reinforced with C-shaped cartilage rings to keep it open and prevent collapse.<br/>5. Bronchi: The trachea divides into two branches called bronchi, one leading to each lung. The bronchi further divide into smaller branches called bronchioles.<br/>6. Bronchioles: The bronchioles are tiny tubes that continue to divide within the lungs, eventually leading to the alveoli.<br/>7. Lungs: Finally, the air reaches the lungs, where gas exchange takes place. The alveoli, small sacs within the lungs, are responsible for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the air and bloodstream.",NA

Exchange of gases in lung alveoli occurs through,NA,C,Active transport,Osmosis,Simple diffusion,Passive transport,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Because in alveoli( richly supplied with blood vessels), where oxygenated blood is present, is absorbed by haemoglobin, present in the RBC(Red Blood Cell). With the help of haemoglobin, the oxygenated blood is diffused in the whole body.
