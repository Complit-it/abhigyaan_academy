Which of the following acts as antibody to help in body defence?,NA,B,Prothrombin,Immunoglobulin,Globulin,Albumin,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Immunoglobulin A (IgA), as the principal antibody class in the secretions that bathe these mucosal surfaces, acts as an important first line of defence. IgA, also an important serum immunoglobulin, mediates a variety of protective functions through interaction with specific receptors and immune mediators. The importance of such protection is underlined by the fact that certain pathogens have evolved mechanisms to compromise IgA-mediated defence, providing an opportunity for more effective invasion. IgA function may also be perturbed in certain disease states, some of which are characterized by deposition of IgA in specific tissues. This review details current understanding of the roles played by IgA in both health and disease.",NA

The longitudinal canals of the bone are called :,NA,B,Volkmann&#39;s canals,Haversian canals,Periosteum,Endosteum,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The longitudinal canals of the bone are called Haversian canals. <br/><br/>Explanation: <br/>The Haversian canals, also known as osteons, are found in compact bone tissue. These canals run parallel to the long axis of the bone and contain blood vessels, nerves, and connective tissue. They are responsible for providing nutrients and oxygen to the bone cells and removing waste products. <br/>The structure of the Haversian canal system includes the following components: <br/>1. Lamellae: These are concentric rings of bone tissue that surround the Haversian canal. They are composed of collagen fibers and mineralized matrix, giving the bone its strength and rigidity. <br/>2. Lacunae: These are small spaces located between the lamellae. They house osteocytes, which are mature bone cells responsible for maintaining the bone tissue. <br/>3. Canaliculi: These are tiny channels that radiate from the lacunae and connect neighboring osteocytes. They allow for communication and exchange of nutrients and waste products between the cells. <br/>4. Volkmann&#39;s canals: These are transverse canals that connect the Haversian canals. They provide additional pathways for blood vessels and nerves to travel between adjacent osteons. <br/>In conclusion, the longitudinal canals of the bone are called Haversian canals, which play a crucial role in the nourishment and health of the bone tissue.",NA
Volkmann&#39;s canals occur in :-,NA,B,Cartilage,Bone,Internal ear,Liver,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is B as Volkmann&#39;s canals are small channels in bone that transmit blood vessels from the periosteum into the bone and that lie perpendicular to and communicate with the Haversian canals.
