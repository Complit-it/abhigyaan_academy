Who among the following introduced local self government in India?,NA,Lord Ripon,Lord Mountbatten,Lord Ripon,Lord Cunning,Lord Macaulay,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is B: Lord Ripon.

Explanation: Lord Ripon, who served as the Viceroy of India from 1880 to 1884, is credited with introducing local self-government in India. In 1882, he introduced the Local Self-Government Resolution, which provided for the establishment of local self-government bodies in rural and urban areas of British India. This resolution marked a significant shift in the governance of India, as it provided for greater participation of Indians in the administration of their own affairs.

Under the Local Self-Government Resolution, local bodies such as municipalities, district boards, and taluk boards were established, which were responsible for the provision of local services such as sanitation, water supply, and roads. The members of these bodies were to be elected by local citizens, thereby providing an opportunity for Indians to participate in the decision-making process.

Lord Mountbatten was the last British Governor-General of India, who oversaw the transfer of power from British rule to Indian independence in 1947. Lord Canning was the first Viceroy of India, who served from 1858 to 1862, after the Indian Rebellion of 1857.

The Poona pact (1932) upheld,NA,Joint electorate with reserved seats for the scheduled castes,Joint electorate ,Separate electorate,Joint electorate with reserved seats for the scheduled castes,Joint electorate with reserved seats for the caste Hindus,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is C: Joint electorate with reserved seats for the scheduled castes.

Explanation:
The Poona Pact was an agreement signed between Mahatma Gandhi, representing the Indian National Congress, and B. R. Ambedkar, representing the Depressed Classes (now known as Scheduled Castes), on 24 September 1932. The agreement was reached after a prolonged and bitter debate between the two leaders over the issue of separate electorates for the Dalits.

The British government had earlier proposed separate electorates for the Dalits, which would have given them their own separate electorate to elect their own representatives. Gandhi was opposed to this idea, as he believed that it would further divide the Hindu community along caste lines. He proposed a system of joint electorates, where members of all castes would vote together, and the Dalits would be given reserved seats in the legislature.

The Poona Pact upheld the principle of joint electorates with reserved seats for the Scheduled Castes. This ensured that the Dalits would have representation in the legislature and a voice in the political process, while also ensuring that the Hindu community remained united. The Poona Pact was a significant moment in the history of Indian politics, as it marked a major victory for the Dalits and helped to bring about greater unity among the Indian people.",NA

It provided for the establishment of an All-India Federation consisting of provinces and princely states as units.

The Act divided the powers between the Centre and Units by three lists—Federal List (for Centre, with 59 items), Provincial List (for provinces, with 54 items) and the Concurrent List (for both, with 36 items).

Residuary powers were given to the Viceroy.

But the federation never came into being as the princely states didn’t join it.

It introduced ‘provincial autonomy’ instead of dyarchy in the provinces.

The provinces were now autonomous units of administration in their own fixed spheres.

It introduced responsible governments in provinces, i.e. the governor was required to act with the advice of ministers responsible to the provincial legislature.

It provided for dyarchy at the Centre.

There was a legislative council (upper house) and a legislative assembly (lower house). However, many restrictions were placed on them.
