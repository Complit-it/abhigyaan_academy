<q>Inversion of Rainfall</q> is associated with,NA,A,Orographic rainfall,Convectional rainfall,Cyclonic rainfall (Tropical),Cyclonic rainfall (Temperate),NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option 1, orographic rainfall.<br/>Inversion of rainfall is a phenomenon that occurs when there is a change in the temperature of the atmosphere with height. In normal atmospheric conditions, the temperature decreases as you move higher in the atmosphere. However, in an inversion, the temperature actually increases with height, creating a layer of warmer air above a cooler layer.<br/><br/>When warm, moist air encounters a mountain range, it is forced to rise and cool. As it does so, the moisture in the air condenses, forming clouds and eventually rainfall. This process is known as orographic rainfall. The presence of an inversion can enhance this process, as the warmer layer of air above the mountain helps to trap and sustain the rising air, leading to increased rainfall.<br/><br/>Convectional rainfall, option 2, occurs when the sun heats the Earth`s surface, causing the air to rise and form clouds. Cyclonic rainfall, both tropical and temperate, option 3 and 4 respectively, is associated with the movement of cyclones (low-pressure systems) that bring large amounts of rainfall. These types of rainfall are not specifically related to the phenomenon of inversion.",NA
Which of the following statements about inversion of temperature is/are correct?<br/>1. Temperature increases with increasing altitude.<br/>2. A long winter night with clear skies is an ideal situation.<br/>3. It is a short term phenomenon and is common all over the globe except at the poles.<br/>Select the correct answer using the code given below :,NA,A,1 and 2 only,2 and 3 only,1 only,"1, 2 and 3",NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option 1, which states that only the first statement is correct, while the other two options are incorrect.<br/>Let us analyze each option to understand why this is the case:<br/>1. The first statement, <q>Temperature increases with increasing altitude</q>, is correct. In the standard atmosphere, the temperature usually decreases with increasing altitude, around 6.5 degrees Celsius per kilometer on average. However, in the case of temperature inversion, the normal temperature decrease is reversed, and the temperature increases with increasing altitude.<br/><br/>2. The second statement, <q>A long winter night with clear skies is an ideal situation</q>, is incorrect. Temperature inversion is more likely to occur during clear nights with light winds, which allows the cooling of the surface to be maximized. Therefore, a long winter night with clear skies is more prone to temperature inversion.<br/><br/>3. The third statement, <q>It is a short-term phenomenon and is common all over the globe except at the poles</q>, is also incorrect. Temperature inversion can be both short-term or long-term, depending on the atmospheric conditions. It can occur globally, including at the poles, although it may be more prevalent in certain regions or seasons.<br/><br/>In conclusion, only the first statement is correct, making option 1 the correct answer.",NA
Which one of following is the most important factor for the formulation of smog?,NA,C,Long winter nights,Formation of an <q>inversion lid</q>,Presence of many air pollutant resources,Rapid fall in temperature with increasing height above the sea level,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Option C is correct. The presence of multiple air pollutant resources, such as industrial emissions, vehicle emissions, and burning of fossil fuels, is a significant factor in smog formation. These pollutants react with sunlight and other chemicals in the atmosphere to form smog.",NA
"If the earth did not have an atmosphere, temperature extremes between day and night would",NA,A,increase,decrease,stay the same,fluctuate rapidly,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Answer is Option 1: Increase. <br/>Without an atmosphere, there would be no air to trap heat and regulate temperatures on the Earth&#39;s surface. During the day, without the atmosphere to block and absorb some of the incoming heat from the sun, the surface temperature of the Earth would increase significantly. This would cause extreme heat during the daytime. At night, without the atmosphere to retain and redistribute some of that heat back to the surface, the temperature would drop rapidly, resulting in extreme cold. The absence of an atmosphere would lead to a more pronounced difference between the maximum and minimum temperatures during the day and night, resulting in increased temperature extremes. Therefore, option 1 is correct.",NA
"As we proceed from equator to poles, the daily range of temperature tends to",NA,A,decrease,increase,be constant,fluctuate,NA,NA,NA,NA,"As we move from the equator towards the poles, the daily range of temperature tends to decrease. This is because the equator receives direct sunlight and is closer to the Sun, resulting in higher temperatures. In contrast, the poles receive less direct sunlight and are further away from the Sun, causing lower temperatures.<br/><br/>The daily range of temperature refers to the difference between the maximum and minimum temperatures observed in a day. At the equator, where the Sun is directly overhead, the maximum temperature tends to be higher, while the minimum temperature remains relatively constant due to the consistent amount of heat received. As we move towards the poles, the angle of the sunlight decreases, resulting in lower maximum temperatures.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the poles experience longer nights during certain times of the year, causing the minimum temperature to drop even further. This difference between the maximum and minimum temperatures becomes smaller as we move towards the poles, leading to a decrease in the daily temperature range.",NA
Atmospheric temperature increasing at the higher altitudes is called,NA,B,Radiation,Inversion,Conduction,Cinvection,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option 2 - Inversion. Inversion refers to a phenomenon where the temperature increases with altitude in the atmosphere instead of the normal decrease with altitude. This occurs when a layer of warm air traps cooler air beneath it, creating a temperature inversion. Inversions can have significant effects on weather patterns and air quality as they can trap pollutants and prevent the upward movement of warm air.<br/><br/>Option 1 - Radiation is not the correct answer as radiation refers to the transfer of heat through electromagnetic waves, and is not specifically related to temperature changes at higher altitudes.<br/><br/>Option 3 - Conduction is the transfer of heat through direct contact between molecules, and is not directly related to temperature changes at higher altitudes.<br/><br/>Option 4 - Convection is the transfer of heat through the movement of fluids, but it is not specifically related to temperature changes at higher altitudes.<br/><br/>Therefore, only option 2 - Inversion is the correct answer for this question.",NA
"Statement I : The decrease of air temperature with increasing altitudes in the atmosphere is called the vertical temperature gradient. <br/>Statement II: In Troposphere, air temperature decreases with increasing altitude due to radiation from the Earth.",NA,B,Both the statements are individually true and Statement II is the correct explanation of Statement I.,Both the statements are individually true but Statement II is not the correct explanation of Statement I,Statement I is true but Statement II is false,Statement I is false but Statement II is true,NA,NA,NA,NA,"In this particular case, Option 2 is the correct answer. <br/>Both statements are individually true, meaning that the decrease of air temperature with increasing altitudes is indeed called the vertical temperature gradient (Statement I), and in the troposphere, the air temperature decreases with increasing altitude due to radiation from the Earth (Statement II). However, Statement II is not the correct explanation of Statement I, as the vertical temperature gradient can also be affected by other factors such as pressure and humidity.",NA
The normal lapse rate to temperature Earth&#39;s atmosphere drops to 0&deg;C at the,NA,D,upper part of ionosphere,upper boundary of the tropopause,lower part of mesosphere,upper boundary of stratopause.,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The normal lapse rate refers to the rate at which temperature decreases with increasing altitude in Earth&#39;s atmosphere. This means that as you go higher in the atmosphere, the temperature tends to decrease. The correct statement in the given options is option 4, which states that the normal lapse rate drops to  0&deg;C  at the upper boundary of the stratopause.<br/><br/>To dissect the other options:<br/>- Option 1 suggests that the normal lapse rate drops to 0&deg;C at the upper part of the ionosphere. The ionosphere is a layer in the upper atmosphere that is ionized by solar radiation. However, the normal lapse rate does not drop to 0&deg;C at the upper part of the ionosphere.<br/><br/>- Option 2 proposes that the normal lapse rate drops to 0&deg;C at the upper boundary of the tropopause. The tropopause is the boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere. While temperature does change at the tropopause, it does not necessarily drop to 0&deg;C.<br/><br/>- Option 3 states that the normal lapse rate drops to 0&deg;C at the lower part of the mesosphere. The mesosphere is the layer above the stratosphere. However, the normal lapse rate does not drop to 0&deg;C at the lower part of the mesosphere.",NA
The temperature increases rapidly above,NA,B,Ionosphere,Exosphere,Stratosphere,Troposphere,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option 2, Exosphere. <br/>The exosphere is the outermost layer of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere. In this layer, the temperature increases rapidly because there are very few particles present to absorb and retain heat. The few particles that do exist in the exosphere have high kinetic energy and can reach very high temperatures.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the troposphere, which is option 4, is the lowest layer of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere, closest to the surface. In the troposphere, the temperature generally decreases with an increase in altitude.<br/><br/>Therefore, although the temperatures change in different layers of the atmosphere, the exosphere is the layer where the temperature increases rapidly.",NA
Which of the following statements about inversion of temperature is/are correct?<br/>1. Temperature increases with increasing altitude.<br/>2. A long winter night with clear skies is an ideal situation.<br/>3. It is a short term phenomenon and is common all over the globe except at the poles.<br/><br/>Select the correct answer using the code given below :,NA,A,1 and 2 only,2 and 3 only,1 only,"1, 2 and 3",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Inversion of temperature:<br/>Under normal conditions, temperature usually decreases with increase in altitude in the troposphere at a rate of 1 degree for every 165 metres. This is called normal lapse rate.<br/>But on some occasions, the situations get reversed and the temperature starts increasing with height rather than decreasing. This is called temperature inversion. Hence, statement 1 is correct.<br/>It is a reversal of the normal behavior of temperature in the troposphere. Under this meteorological phenomenon a layer of warm air lies over the cold air layer.<br/>It is caused in stac atmospheric conditions while some times, it occurs due to horizontal or vertical movement of air.<br/>Temperature inversion is usually of short duration but quite common nonetheless.<br/><br/>???Favourable Conditions for Temperature Inversion:<br/>Long winter nights: Loss of heat by terrestrial radiation from the ground surface during night may exceed the amount of incoming solar radiation.<br/>- Cloudless and clear sky. Loss of heat through terrestrial radiation proceeds more rapidly without any obstruction. Hence, statement 2 is correct.<br/>- Dry air near the ground surface <br/>-Slow movement of air<br/>- Snow covered ground surface<br/>It results in maximum loss of heat through reflection of incoming solar radiation.<br/>This regular temperature inversion in the high Arctic is caused by the lack of surface heating by the Sun, which stays below the horizon during the winter (the Polar Night), and the continuous loss of heat from the surface (through emission of infrared radiation). <br/>Hence, temperature inversion is common phenomenon at the poles. Hence, statement 3 is not correct.",NA
Temperature inversion is a condition in which the temperature of the atmosphere-,NA,D,Either increases or decreases with altitude ,Remains same,Always decreases with altitude,Always increases with altitude,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Concept:<br/><br/>-A temperature inversion is a condition in which the temperature of the atmosphere increases with altitude.<br/>-When the temperature of the environment increases with altitude, then the lapse rate becomes inverted or negative from its normal state.<br/>-Negative lapse rate occurs under condition, usually referred to as inversion, a state in which the warmer air lies over the colder air below.<br/>-The radiation inversion is a phenomenon occurring from the unequal cooling rates for the earth and air above the earth.<br/>-Such an inversion in the environment helps in the formation of fog when air is wet, and simultaneously catches gases and particulate matter, as it stops their upward-lifting, thereby creating a concentration of pollutants in our close environment.",NA
The temperature inversion is,NA,D,whenever the normal decrease of atmospheric temperature,when the decrease in temperature or moisture or both takes place,whenever the normal decrease of atmospheric temperature or moisture or both change with height over,All of the above,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is : D. All of the above. <br/><br/>A temperature inversion is a layer of Earth&#39;s atmosphere where temperature increases with height. This is opposite to the normal situation, where temperature decreases with height. Temperature inversions can occur in the lower atmosphere (troposphere) or the upper atmosphere (stratosphere). <br/><br/>Temperature inversions can be caused by a number of factors, including: <br/><br/> i) Subsidence: When air sinks, it warms. This can cause a temperature inversion if the sinking air is not mixed with the surrounding air.<br/> ii) Advection: When warm air moves over cold air, the warm air can form a layer on top of the cold air. This can cause a temperature inversion.<br/> iii) radiation: At night, the Earth&#39;s surface cools by radiating heat into space. This can cause a temperature inversion if the air near the surface is cooler than the air above it. <br/><br/>temperature inversions can have a number of effects, including<br/> i) Reduced visibility: Temperature inversions can trap pollutants near the ground, which can reduce visibility.<br/> ii) Smog: Temperature inversion can also trap water vapor near the ground, which can lead to the formation of smog.<br/> iii) Heat waves: Temperature inversions can trap heat nea r the ground , which can lead to heat waves.",NA
