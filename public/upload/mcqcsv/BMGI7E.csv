The system of apartheid, which was officially introduced in 1948, institutionalized racial segregation and denied black people equal rights and opportunities.<br/><br/>Key Events:<br/>1. 1990: The first significant step towards equality came in 1990 when President F.W. de Klerk announced the unbanning of the ANC and other anti-apartheid organizations. This signaled the beginning of negotiations to dismantle apartheid and establish a new democratic South Africa.<br/>2. 1994: The year 1994 marked a monumental milestone in South Africa's history.

Nelson Mandela, who had been released from prison in 1990, became the country's first black president.<br/>3. 1996: The new democratic government took significant steps towards achieving equal citizenship rights for all South Africans. In 1996, the South African constitution was adopted, which enshrined fundamental rights and freedoms for all citizens, regardless of race.<br/>4. 1998: The South African government also established the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in 1995, which aimed to address the crimes and human rights violations committed during the apartheid era.
