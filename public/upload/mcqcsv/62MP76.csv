What should be the proportion of forest cover for India to maintain her ecological balance?,NA,C,11.1 percent,22.2 percent,33.3 percent,44.4 percent,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Explanation:<br/>The correct answer is option 3, which states that the proportion of forest cover for India to maintain her ecological balance should be 33.3 percent.<br/>Ecological balance refers to the equilibrium and sustainability of ecological systems. Forests play a crucial role in maintaining this balance as they provide habitat for various species, contribute to climate regulation, conserve water, and prevent soil erosion. A 33.3 percent forest cover is necessary to ensure these functions are adequately fulfilled. <br/>Option 1 (11.1 percent) and option 2 (22.2 percent) would be insufficient for maintaining the ecological balance, while option 4 (44.4 percent) would exceed the required proportion. <br/>Therefore, option 3 is the most appropriate answer.",NA

Alluvial soils vary in nature from sandy loam to clay. They are generally,NA,D,poor in potash and rich in phosphorous,poor in both potash and phosphorous,rich in both potash and phosphorous,rich in potash and poor in phosphorus,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Alluvial soils are sedimentary soils that are deposited by rivers and streams. They are known for their fertile nature and are commonly found in river valleys and floodplains. These soils can vary in composition from sandy loam to clay, indicating different levels of sand, silt, and clay particles in the soil.<br/><br/>The given correct answer is option 4, which states that alluvial soils are rich in potash and poor in phosphorus. Potash refers to a group of minerals that are a source of potassium, an essential nutrient for plant growth. Alluvial soils generally have a good amount of potassium, making them rich in potash.<br/><br/>On the other hand, alluvial soils are poor in phosphorus. Phosphorus is another crucial nutrient required for plant growth, but it is not typically abundant in alluvial soils. Plants may need to supplement their phosphorus requirements through fertilizers or organic matter.<br/><br/>Therefore, it is important to note that although alluvial soils vary in nature from sandy loam to clay, they are generally rich in potash and poor in phosphorus, making option 4 the correct answer.",NA

Which one of the following is not a soil forming factor?,NA,D,Parent material,Topography,Climate,Human habitation,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is 4) Human habitation.<br/>Soil formation is influenced by several factors, including parent material, topography, climate, organisms, and time. However, human habitation is not considered a soil forming factor.<br/><br/>1) Parent material: Parent material refers to the material from which the soil is derived. It can consist of rocks, minerals, weathered material, or organic matter. The characteristics of the parent material greatly influence the properties of the resulting soil.<br/>2) Topography: Topography refers to the physical features of the land, such as slopes, hills, and valleys. It affects the accumulation and movement of water, which in turn influences soil formation.<br/>3) Climate: Climate plays a crucial role in soil formation. Factors such as temperature, precipitation, and the length of the growing season affect the rates of weathering, erosion, and organic matter decomposition.<br/>4) Human habitation: While human activities can affect soil properties and quality, they are not considered a soil forming factor. Human habitation can lead to soil erosion, contamination, compaction, or alteration of natural vegetation, but it does not play a direct role in the actual formation of soil.<br/><br/>Therefore, option 4 - Human habitation is the correct answer.",NA
Alluvial soils are rich soil for crop cultivation but are poor in,NA,B,humus,nitrogen and humus,organic material,inorganic material,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option B, which states that alluvial soils are poor in nitrogen and humus. <br/>Alluvial soils are formed by the deposition of sediments carried by rivers or streams over long periods of time. They are known for their fertility and are often used for crop cultivation. However, they do lack certain elements necessary for plant growth.<br/>Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for plants and is responsible for their overall growth and development. Humus, on the other hand, is organic matter that contributes to soil fertility and helps retain moisture. Both nitrogen and humus are important for healthy crop growth, and their absence in alluvial soils can limit the productivity of crops grown in these soils. It is necessary to supplement these nutrients through fertilization in order to optimize crop yields.",NA
Which one of the following practices is adopted for restoring the fertility of soil?,NA,C,Weeding,Levelling,Fallowing,Harrowing,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option C: Fallowing. <br/>Fallowing is a practice where a piece of land is left uncultivated for a certain period of time to restore its fertility. This is done by allowing natural processes to occur, such as the breakdown of organic matter, the replenishment of nutrients, and the improvement of soil structure. <br/>During fallowing, the land is not used for cultivation and is usually left with vegetation to protect the soil from erosion and enhance the accumulation of organic matter. <br/>This practice helps to improve the nutrient content and moisture retention capacity of the soil, making it more suitable for crop cultivation in subsequent seasons. Fallowing is an effective and sustainable method to restore the fertility of the soil over time.",NA

The colour of loamy soil is,NA,D,Greenish brown,Bluish green,Yellowish brown,Blackish brown,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option 4: Blackish brown. <br/>Loamy soil is a type of soil that has a good combination of sand, silt, and clay. It is known for its high fertility and ability to retain moisture. The color of loamy soil can vary depending on its composition, but it is generally dark in color. This is because loamy soil contains organic matter, such as decaying plant and animal materials, which give it a darker hue. <br/><br/>The term <q>blackish brown</q> describes the color of loamy soil accurately, conveying its dark appearance. It is important to note that the color of loamy soil may slightly vary depending on the amount of organic matter present and the specific location.",NA
Transition zone of varied natural vegetation occupying the boundary between two adjacent and differing plant communities is known as,NA,B,ecological succession,ecotone,ecological niche,climax,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option B: ecotone. An ecotone is the transition zone between two different plant communities or ecosystems. It is a boundary where the vegetation gradually changes from one type to another. Ecotones can be found in various natural habitats such as forests, wetlands, and grasslands. They are characterized by a mix of plant species from both adjacent communities and may have a unique set of environmental conditions and species that are adapted to the specific conditions found in the ecotone.<br/><br/>Option A, ecological succession, refers to the process of gradual change in the composition of species within a community over time.
