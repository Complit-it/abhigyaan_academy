Which one of the following tissues is responsible for increase of girth in the stem of a plant?,NA,D,Tracheid,Pericycle,Intercalary meristem,Lateral meristem,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Answer is D. Lateral meristem. <br/><br/>Option 1: Tracheids are a type of cells that transport water and minerals in the xylem tissue of plants. These cells are responsible for water movement, not for the increase in the girth of the stem. Therefore, option 1 is incorrect.<br/><br/>Option 2: The pericycle is a tissue located in the outer layer of the plant&#39;s vascular cylinder. It has roles in lateral root development and nutrient uptake. However, the pericycle is not responsible for the increase in stem girth. Therefore, option 2 is incorrect.<br/><br/>Option 3: Intercalary meristem is a type of meristematic tissue found in the internodes of grasses and some other monocots. It is responsible for the elongation of stems. It does not contribute to the increase in stem girth. Therefore, option 3 is incorrect.<br/><br/>Option 4: Lateral meristem, specifically the vascular cambium and the cork cambium, is responsible for the increase in the girth of the stem. The vascular cambium produces secondary xylem towards the inside of the stem and secondary phloem towards the outside. This results in the thickening of the stem.<br/>Therefore, option 4 is correct.",NA

Growth and repair of damaged tissue involve,NA,A,Mitotic cell division only,Both mitotic and meiotic cell divisions,Meiotic cell division only,Amniotic cell division only,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The growth and repair of damaged tissue involve option 1, which is <b>mitotic cell division only.</b><br/><br/>Mitotic cell division, also known as mitosis, is the process by which a single cell divides into two identical daughter cells. This type of cell division is responsible for the growth of tissues during development and the replacement of damaged or old cells.<br/>During mitosis, the cell goes through a series of stages, including prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase, to ensure the accurate distribution of genetic material to the daughter cells. The cell`s DNA is replicated and condensed into chromosomes, which are then pulled apart into two separate nuclei.<br/>On the other hand, meiotic cell division, or meiosis, is a special type of cell division that only occurs in certain cells involved in the production of gametes (sperm and eggs). Meiosis involves two rounds of division, resulting in the production of four non-identical daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. This process is essential for sexual reproduction but is not directly involved in tissue growth and repair.",NA
"Which one of the following plant plastids stores starch, oil and protein granules?",NA,B,Chloroplast,Leucoplast,Chromoplast,Xanthoplast,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Option 1: Chloroplasts are responsible for photosynthesis, where they convert sunlight into energy and produce glucose. They contain chlorophyll, which gives them their green color. However, chloroplasts primarily store starch as a form of energy, rather than granules of oil or protein. Therefore, option 1 is not the correct answer.<br/><br/>Option 2: Leucoplasts are the correct answer. These plastids are colorless and are responsible for storing starch, oil, and protein granules. They can be found in non-photosynthetic plant tissues such as roots and tubers. Leucoplasts come in different forms, including amyloplasts for starch storage, elaioplasts for oil storage, and proteinoplasts for protein storage. Therefore, option 2 is the correct answer.<br/><br/>Option 3: Chromoplasts are responsible for storing pigments other than chlorophyll. They are found in fruits, flowers, and roots, giving them their distinct colors. However, chromoplasts do not store starch, oil, or protein granules. Therefore, option 3 is not the correct answer.<br/><br/>Option 4: Xanthoplasts are not a recognized type of plastid. Therefore, option 4 is not the correct.",NA
All the progeny obtained from a single plant by vegetative propagation are called,NA,A,Clones,Pure line,Inred line,Pedigree line,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option 1, clones. <br/>When a plant is propagated vegetatively, it means that new plants are produced from a single parent plant without the involvement of seeds. <br/>The progeny or offspring that are obtained from this process are genetically identical to the parent plant, as they are formed from the cells or tissues of the parent plant. <br/>These genetically identical plants are referred to as clones. This is because they have the exact same genetic makeup as the parent plant, which means they have the same traits and characteristics. <br/>Cloning through vegetative propagation is commonly used in agriculture, horticulture, and forestry to produce plants with desirable traits and characteristics.",NA
