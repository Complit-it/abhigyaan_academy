Which one of the following metals is kept immersed in Kerosene oil to protect it and to prevent accidental fire ?,NA,B,Calcium,Sodium,Vanadium,Magnesium,NA,NA,NA,NA,"<b>The correct answer is option 2: Sodium.</b><br/><br/>Metallic sodium is kept immersed in kerosene oil to protect it and prevent accidental fire. Sodium is a highly reactive metal that can react violently with oxygen in the air, causing a fire. By keeping sodium immersed in kerosene oil, it is protected from contact with oxygen and moisture in the air, which reduces the risk of it catching fire.Sodium reacts vigorously with water, releasing hydrogen gas and heat. Kerosene oil, on the other hand, is non-polar and does not react with sodium. It acts as a barrier, preventing contact between sodium and water.Calcium (option 1), vanadium (option 3), and magnesium (option 4) are not typically stored in kerosene oil. While these metals may react with oxygen or water to some extent, they are not as reactive as sodium.In conclusion, sodium is the metal that is kept immersed in kerosene oil to protect it and prevent accidental fire.",NA
