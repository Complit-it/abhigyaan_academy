Which one of the following is not a land-use category?,NA,D,Forestland,Pasture land,Marginal land,Barren and wasteland,NA,NA,NA,NA,"All the options listed are related to how land can be used; however, these categories can vary depending on their definition in different contexts.<br/>Option 1: <q>Forestland</q> refers to land that is predominantly covered by trees. It is widely recognized as a specific land-use category because it supports a unique ecosystem and contributes to the carbon cycle.<br/>Option 2: <q>Pasture land</q> is another recognized land-use category. This type of land is used to graze livestock and supports the production of meat, dairy, and wool.<br/>Option 3: <q>Marginal land</q> pertains to land that has little or no potential for profit in its current state. This land may be too rocky, too dry, or generally unsuitable for traditional crops or farming.<br/>Option 4: <q>Barren and wasteland</q> is not necessarily a land-use category. Rather, this refers to a description of land condition. Generally, barren lands or wastelands refer to spaces that cannot support any noticeable plant or animal life because of harsh conditions or degradation. These areas, however, may still fall under other land-use categories, depending on how they are utilized or managed. For instance, a barren land may still be used for mining purposes.",NA
What is the ground on which the Supreme Court can refuse relief under Article 32?,NA,C,The aggrieved person can get remedy from another court,That disputed facts have to be investigated,That no fundamental right has been infringed,That the petitioner has not asked for the proper writ applicable to his/her case,NA,NA,NA,NA,"<b>Article 32 of the Indian Constitution provides the right to constitutional remedies.

Which one of the following is the correct sequence of organs that occur in the path of urine flow in the human body?,NA,A,"Kidney, ureter, urinary bladder, urethra","Kidney, urinary bladder, ureter, urethra","Kidney, ureter, urethra, urinary bladder","Urinary bladder, kidney, urethra, ureter",NA,NA,NA,NA,"<b>Explanation:<br/>The correct sequence of organs involved in the path of urine flow is Kidney -> Ureter -> Urinary Bladder -> Urethra and hence, Option 1 is correct.</b><br/><br/>Option 2 suggests that urine goes from the Kidney to the Urinary Bladder, then to the Ureter, which is incorrect as urine travels from the Kidney to the Ureter first.<br/>Option 3 posits the flow as Kidney -> Ureter -> Urethra -> Urinary Bladder, which is incorrect as well. The urinary bladder is where urine is stored before it is expelled, not after it travels through the urethra.<br/>Option 4 starts with the Urinary bladder, which is incorrect as urine is first produced in the Kidneys, not stored in the bladder.<b>This explanation should help make the path of urine flow clear for students.</b>",NA
Which one of the following is not a property of the X-rays?,NA,A,They are deflected by electric fields.,They are not deflected by magnetic fields.,They have high penetration length in matter.,"<b>The correct sequence of the formation of the Commissions starting from the earliest is as per option 2.

They are composed of photons which are not charged particles hence they do not react to electric or magnetic fields.<br/>Option 2 is correct, X-rays are not deflected by magnetic fields for the same reason mentioned above.<br/>Option 3 is also true. X-rays have higher penetrating power in matter due to their high energy and small wavelength.<br/>Option 4 is right as well. The wavelength of X-rays is much smaller than that of visible light, which is why X-rays have more energy and penetration capacity than visible light.<br/><br/><b>So, the provided answer that X-rays are deflected by electric fields (option 1) is a property that X-rays do not have, making it the correct choice.</b>",NA

This is associated with the 7th Schedule.<br/>Option 2 is correct. The 11th Schedule provides for the devolution of powers and responsibilities to the panchayats to prepare plans for economic development and social justice concerning 29 matters listed in the schedule, hence it is all about the State Legislatures and the Panchayat.<br/>Option 3 is incorrect because these powers are not distributed between the Municipal Corporation and the Panchayat.

Which one of the following is not correct about Repo rate?,NA,D,It is the interest rate charged by the Central Bank of overnight loan.,It is the interest rate paid by the commercial banks on overnight borrowing.,It is the interest rate agreed upon in the loan contract between a commercial bank and the Central Bank.,It is the cost of collateral security.,NA,NA,NA,NA,"<b>The repo rate is an instrument of monetary policy that central banks use to control liquidity and inflation in the economy.</b><br/><br/>Option 1 is correct since the repo rate is the interest rate charged by the Central Bank of an overnight loan to a commercial bank.<br/>Option 2 is also correct. From the commercial bank`s perspective, the repo rate is the interest paid on overnight borrowings from the central bank.<br/>Option 3 is incorrect, and therefore the right answer. In a repo operation, the interest rate isn`t a variable part of the loan contract, rather it is set by the central bank independently and used uniformly in all transactions it conducts with the commercial banks.<br/>Option 4 is potentially misleading: while the repo rate does factor in the cost of collateral security in an indirect way, describing it as `the cost of collateral security` isn`t entirely accurate.

The property of the sound waves that determines the pitch of the sound is its,NA,B,Frequency,Amplitude,Wavelength,Intensity,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Option 1: Frequency - Correct answer. In the context of sound waves, frequency refers to the number of cycles of a wave that pass a certain point in a specific unit of time. The unit of frequency is the Hertz (Hz). Frequency is directly linked to the pitch of the sound: higher frequency leads to a higher pitched sound while a lower frequency leads to a deeper or lower pitched sound.<br/>Option 2: Amplitude - This represents the size or magnitude of the sound wave. In simpler terms, it refers to how <q>loud</q> or <q>soft</q> the sound is. Changes in amplitude do not affect the pitch of the sound.<br/>Option 3: Wavelength - This represents the length of one complete wave cycle. While wavelength is inversely related to frequency, it doesn&#39;t directly determine the pitch of the sound.<br/>Option 4: Intensity - It is the amount of energy carried by the wave per unit of time across a surface. Like amplitude, it is associated with the loudness of the sound, not the pitch.<br/><b>In summary, frequency plays a key role in determining the pitch of a sound wave, whereas amplitude and intensity influence the loudness and wavelength influences the wave cycle.</b>",NA
