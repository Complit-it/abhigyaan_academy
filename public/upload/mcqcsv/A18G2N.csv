What is the latent heat of fusion?,NA,B,The amount of heat needed to change the temperature of a substance.,The heat required to convert a substance from a solid to a liquid state without changing its temperature.,The heat required to vaporize a substance.,The heat required to change the Temperature of a substance from 0°C to 100°C.,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Correct Answer is Option B.<br/>Option B specifically describes the concept of latent heat of fusion. When a substance changes from a solid to a liquid state (such as ice melting into water), it requires a certain amount of heat energy without a change in temperature.
