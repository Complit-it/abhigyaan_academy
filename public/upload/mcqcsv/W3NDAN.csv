The latest discovered state of matter is,NA,B,Solid,Bose-Einstein Condensate,Plasma,Liquid,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option 2 - Bose-Einstein condensate.<br/><br/>Solid, liquid, gas, and plasma are the four states of matter that are commonly known. However, in 1995, a new state of matter called Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) was discovered by physicists Eric Cornell, Carl Wieman, and Wolfgang Ketterle.<br/>Bose-Einstein condensate is a unique state of matter that occurs at extremely low temperatures, close to absolute zero (-273.15 degrees Celsius or -459.67 degrees Fahrenheit). In this state, a group of atoms or particles, known as bosons, come together and lose their individual identities, behaving as a single entity with wave-like properties.<br/>Bose-Einstein condensate exhibits fascinating phenomena, such as superfluidity and quantum coherence, which are not observed in other states of matter. It has provided valuable insights into quantum mechanics and has opened up new avenues of research in fields like atomic physics and condensed matter physics.<br/>In summary, Bose-Einstein condensate is a unique state of matter that was discovered in 1995 and exists at extremely low temperatures, demonstrating remarkable quantum properties.",NA
"Matter around us can exist in three different states, namely, solid, liquid and gas. The correct order of their compressibility is",NA,B,Liquid < Gas < Solid,Solid < Liquid < Gas,Gas < Liquid < Solid,Solid < Gas < Liquid,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The correct answer is option 2: Solid < Liquid < Gas. <br/><br/>Compressibility is a measure of how easily a substance can be compressed or squeezed into a smaller volume. In solids, the particles are tightly packed together and have very little space to move, making them less compressible. Therefore, solids have the lowest compressibility among the three states of matter.<br/>In liquids, the particles are not as tightly packed as in solids, allowing them to move past each other more freely. Although liquids are more compressible than solids, they still have a relatively low compressibility compared to gases.<br/>Gases have particles that are more spread out and have a lot of space between them. This allows gas particles to move freely and easily compress when subjected to pressure. Therefore, gases have the highest compressibility among the three states of matter.<br/>To summarize, the correct order of compressibility is: Solid < Liquid < Gas.",NA
Under what conditions does diffusion occur faster?,NA,C,Low temperature,Low pressure,High temperature,High pressure,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Diffusion becomes faster at high temperatures.
