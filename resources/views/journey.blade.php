						<h1>Pre-journey checks</h1>
						<p>Pre-journey checks help you to drive more safely, avoid unnecessary breakdowns and make your long trip easier and a lot more enjoyable.</p>
						<ol style="list-style-type: none;">
						  <li>
							<h2>Tyre pressures and spare tyre</h2>
							<p>The correct tyre pressures are essential to making sure that your car can break, grip and steer properly. You should always have a spare tyre with you for emergencies. Nowadays for tubeless tyres one can keep the kit to seal any air leakage from the tyre.</p>
						  </li>
						  <li>
							<h2>Windscreen wipers and screen wash</h2>
							<p>Driving with a dirty or smeared windscreen is frustrating, but it can also be dangerous. Check your windscreen wipers for wear and replace them if needed.</p>
						  </li>
						  <li>
							<h2>Lights</h2>
							<p>Fully functioning lights are essential for safe travel, not just so you can see clearly but also so that other road users can see you and know your intentions. Before a long journey is a good time to check your headlights, indicators and brake lights.</p>
						  </li>
						  <li>
							<h2>Air conditioning</h2>
							<p>If you have an air conditioner in your vehicle then it’s a great idea to make sure your air conditioner is in tip-top shape before spending hours at a time in the car. The last thing you want is to get stuck in traffic with no way to cool down.</p>
						  </li>
						  <li>
							<h2>Oil level</h2>
							<p>Oil is absolutely vital in keeping your car’s engine running smoothly. Running low on oil could cause costly damage or leave you stranded – which is the last thing you want when you’re a long way from home. Traditionally, every car came with a dipstick to allow you to check the oil level yourself. Many modern cars no longer have dipsticks and instead, use the car’s computer to monitor the oil level and display it on the dashboard. You should check your car’s handbook to see if this is the case for you.</p>
						  </li>
						  <li>
							<h2>Engine coolant</h2>
							<p>Coolant keeps your car’s engine healthy by regulating the temperature of the cooling system. Many newer cars have a closed cooling system which means they don’t need topping up. With older cars, you may need to check the level of coolant yourself and top it up if necessary. You can see the fluid level in a reservoir in the engine bay. If it’s close to, or below, the marker for the minimum level, you’ll need a refill.</p>
						  </li>

With older cars, you may need to check the level of coolant yourself and top it up if necessary. You can see the fluid level in a reservoir in the engine bay. If it’s close to, or below, the marker for the minimum level, you’ll need a refill.</p>
					  </li>
					  <li>
						<h2>Brake fluid</h2>
						<p>While you’re under the bonnet, check the fluid level in your car’s braking system. This fluid is essential for making sure your brakes work, so don’t take any chances with it. Your car’s manual will tell you where to look in the engine bay. Much like the coolant, you’re looking for a reservoir with markers showing you the lowest recommended level of fluid. If the brake fluid level is below that marker, top it up by unscrewing the lid and adding the recommended type of fluid. Again, your car’s manual will tell you what kind to use.</p>
					  </li>
					  <li>

					  <h2>Tyre tread depth</h2>
					  <p>Worn tyres can seriously affect your car’s handling, braking and safety as a whole. Before a long journey, check that your tyre treads have a minimum depth of 1.6mm across the central three-quarters where it hits the road using a measuring gauge. If your tread has worn down to between 1.6mm and 3mm in depth, consider replacing your tyres before your trip.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
					  <h2>Fuel level</h2>
					  <p>Most people are keen to get on the road and make good progress, but filling up with a tank of fuel at or near the start of your journey could save you time (and reduce stress) later on. Knowing that you’ve got a full tank gives you peace of mind and could stop you from having to drive around an unfamiliar location towards the end of your journey, desperately hunting for a fuel station.</p>
					  <p>If you have a plug-in hybrid or electric car, make sure it’s fully charged before setting off. Some also allow you to set a timer to pre-cool or pre-heat the car while it’s charging. It’s worth doing this because it reduces the amount of battery power you use once you start moving.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
					  <h2>Emergency supplies</h2>
					  <p>Pack anything that may be useful in an emergency if you were to break down. A red warning triangle is highly recommended in order to alert other drivers of your presence. It’s always worth keeping some spare clothes and snacks in the car in case you get stuck somewhere for a while. If you’re driving in Europe you may need to pack a few additional items – in France, for example, you are required by law to have two warning triangles, a reflective jacket and a first-aid kit in your car.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
					  <h2>Battery</h2>
					  <p>A petrol or diesel car’s battery will degrade over time and will need to be replaced. Usually, this happens every few years, but it’s important to keep an eye on how it’s performing – if it drops below a certain operating level, your car won’t start, leaving you stranded.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
					  <h2>Have your car serviced regularly</h2>
					  <p>The best way to make sure your car is ready for a long journey is by having it regularly serviced. That way you know you’ve done everything you can to keep it running efficiently and safely. Many cars will remind you with a message on the dashboard when a service is due. If in doubt, check your car’s handbook or service record to see when its next check-up is due.</p>
